      &ldquo;Merrie England in the Olden Time&rdquo; having found favour with the Public in
      &ldquo;<i>Bentley's Miscellany</i>,&rdquo; puts forth new attractions in the present
      volumes. It has received numerous and important corrections and additions;
      the story has been illustrated by those eminent artists Messrs. Leech and
      Robert Cruikshank; and fac-similes, faithfully executed by that &ldquo;cunninge&rdquo;
       limner Mr. Thomas Gilks, of rare and unique portraits of celebrated
      Players, Jesters, Conjurers, and Mountebanks, (preserved only in the
      cabinets of the curious,) exhibit &ldquo;lively sculptures&rdquo; of once popular
      drolls and wizards that shook the sides and &ldquo;astonished the nerves&rdquo; of our
      jovial-hearted and wondering ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      To supply the antiquarian portion of Merrie England, a library and a
      collection of prints and drawings of a highly curious and <i>recherche</i>
      character have been resorted to; and, though the task of concentrating and
      reducing into moderate compass such ample materials has not been an easy
      one,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The labour we delight in physics pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, and a large share of public approval, have made it a &ldquo;labour of
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that part which is purely fiction the <i>characters</i> can best speak
      for themselves.

      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>outh is the season
      of ingenuousness and enjoyment, when we desire to please, and blush not to
      own ourselves pleased. At that happy period there is no affectation of
      wisdom; we look only to the bright and beautiful: we inquire not whether
      it be an illusion; it is sufficient that fairy land, with its flowers of
      every hue, is the path on which we tread. To youth succeeds manhood, with
      its worldly prudence: then we are taught to take nothing, not even
      happiness, upon trust; to investigate until we are lost in the intricacies
      of detail; and to credit our judgment for what is due only to our coldness
      and apathy. We lose all sympathy for the past; the future is the subject
      of our anxious speculation; caution and re serve are our guardian angels;
      and if the heart still throb with a fond emotion, we stifle it with what
      speed we may, as detrimental to our interests, and unworthy our new-born
      intelligence and philosophy. A short acquaintance with the world will
      convince the most sanguine that this stage is not the happiest; that
      ambition and mercenary cares make up the tumultuous scene; and though
      necessity compel a temporary submission, it is good to escape from the
      toils, and breathe a purer air. This brings us to another period, when
      reflection has taught us self-knowledge, and we are no longer overwise in
      our own esteem. Then returns something of the simplicity that
      characterised our early days. We welcome old friends; have recourse to old
      amusements, and the fictions that enchained our youthful fancy resume
      their wonted spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      We remember the time when just emerging from boyhood, we affected a
      disdain for the past. We had put on the man, and no urchin that put on for
      the first time his holiday suit, felt more inexpressible self-complacency.
      We had roared at pantomime, and gaped with delight at the mysteries of
      melodrame&mdash;but now becoming too sober to be amused, &ldquo;puerile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ridiculous!&rdquo; were the critical anathemas that fulminated from our
      newly-imbibed absolute wisdom! It might be presumption to say that we have
      since grown wiser; certain it is, we are become less pleased with
      ourselves, and consequently more willing to be pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentle Reader, we are old enough to have enjoyed, and young enough to
      remember many of the amusements, wakes, and popular drolleries of <i>Merrie
      England</i> that have long since submitted to &ldquo;the tooth of time and
      razure of oblivion.&rdquo; Like Parson Adams, we have also been a great
      traveller&mdash;in our books! Reversing the well-known epigram,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Give me the thing that's pretty, smart, and new:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      All ugly, old, odd things, I leave to you,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      we have all our life been a hunter after oddities. We have studied
      attentively the past. For the future we have been moderately solicitous;
      there being so many busy economists to take the unthankful task off our
      hands. We have lost our friend rather than our joke, when the joke has
      been the better of the two; and have been free of discourse where it has
      been courteously received, preferring (in the cant of pompous ignorance,
      which is dear at any price!) to make ourselves &ldquo;<i>cheap</i>&rdquo; rather than
      be set down as exclusive and unkind. Disappointments we have had, and
      sorrows, with ample experience of the world's ingratitude. But life is too
      short to harbour enmities; and to be resentful is to be unhappy. This may
      have cast a transient shade over our lucubrations, which let thy happier
      humour shine upon and dispel! Wilt thou accept us for thy Cicerone through
      a journey of strange sights? the curiosities of nature, and the
      whimsicalities of art. We promise thee faster speed than steam-boat and
      railroad: for thou shalt traverse the ground of two centuries in two
      hours! With pleasant companions by the way, free from the perils of fire
      and flood,

    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Fancy, like the finger of a clock,

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ost thou think
      because thou art virtuous there shall be no more cakes and ale?&rdquo; was the
      admirable reply of Sir Toby Belch to Malvolio when he would have marred
      his Christmas * merrymaking with Sir Andrew and the Clown. And how
      beautiful is Olivia's reply to the self-same precisian when the searching
      apophthegms of the &ldquo;foolish wise man, or wise foolish man,&rdquo; sounded like
      discords in his ears. &ldquo;O, you are sick of selflove, Malvolio, and taste
      all with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free
      disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem
      cannon-bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
      nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do
      nothing but reprove.&rdquo;

     * Christmas being the season when Jack Frost commonly takes
     us by the nose, the diversions are within doors, either in
     exercise, or by the fire-side. Viz. a game at blind-man's-
     buff, puss-in-the-corner, questions and commands, hoop-and-
     hide; stories of hobgoblins, Tom-pokers, bull-beggars,
     witches, wizards, conjurors, Doctor Faustus, Friar Bacon,
     Doctor Partridge, and such-like horrible bodies, that
     terrify and delight!

     &ldquo;O you merry, merry souls,

      There are such things as opaque wits and perverse minds, as there are
      squinting eyes and crooked legs; but we desire not to entertain such
      guests either as companions or foils. We come not to the conclusion that
      the world is split into two classes, <i>viz</i>. those who <i>are</i> and
      those who <i>ought to be</i> hanged; that we should believe every man to
      be a rogue till we find him honest. There is quite virtue enough in human
      life to make our journey moderately happy. We are of the hopeful order of
      beings, and think this world a very beautiful world, if man would not mar
      it with his pride, selfishness, and gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been a maxim among all great and wise nations to encourage public
      sports and diversions. The advantages that arise from them to a state; the
      benefit they are to all degrees of the people; the right purposes they may
      be made to serve in troublesome times, have generally been so well
      understood by the ruling powers, that they have seldom permitted them to
      suffer from the assaults of narrow-minded and ignorant reformers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our ancestors were wise when they appointed amusements for the people. And
      as religious services (which are the means, not the end&mdash;the road to
      London is not London) were never intended for a painful duty, the &ldquo;drum
      ecclesiastic,&rdquo; which in latter times called its recruits to pillage and
      bloodshed, often summoned Punch, Robin Hood, and their merry crew, to
      close the motley ceremonies of a holy-appointed day! Then was the calendar
      Devotion's diary and Mirth's manual! Rational pleasure is heightened by
      participation; solitary enjoyment is always selfish. Who ever inquires
      after a sour recluse, except his creditors and next heir? Nobody misses
      him when there are so many more agreeable people to supply his place. Of
      what use is such a negative, &ldquo;crawling betwixt earth and heaven?&rdquo; If he
      hint that Diogenes, * dying of the dumps, may be found at home in his tub,
      who cares to disinter him? Oh, the deep solitude of a great city to a
      morose and selfish spirit! The Hall of Eblis is not more terrible. Away,
      then, with supercilious exclusiveness! 'Tis the grave of the affections!
      the charnel-house of the heart! What to us is the world, if to the world
      we are nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      We delight to see a fool ** administer to his brethren.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Diogenes, when he trod with his dirty cobbled shoes on the
     beautiful carpets of Plato, exclaimed triumphantly, &ldquo;I tread
     upon the pride of Plato!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Plato, &ldquo;but with
     a greater pride!&rdquo;

     ** &ldquo;A material fool,&rdquo; as Jacques describes Touchstone. Such
     was Dr. Andrew Borde, the well-known progenitor of Merry
     Andrews; and the presumed author of the &ldquo;Merry Tales of the
     Wise Men of Gotham,&rdquo; composed in the early part of the
     sixteenth century. &ldquo;In the time of Henry VIII. and after,&rdquo;
      (says Anthony à Wood,) &ldquo;it was accounted a book full of wit
     and mirth by the scholars and gentlemen.&rdquo; It is thus
     referred to in an old play of 1560:&mdash;

     &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
     I must needs laughe  in my slefe.
     The wise men of Gotum are risen againe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      If merriment sometimes ran riot, it never exhibited itself in those
      deep-laid villanies so rife among the pretenders to sanctity and
      mortification. An appeal to &ldquo;clubs&rdquo; among the London apprentices; the
      pulling down of certain mansions of iniquity, of which <i>Mrs. Cole</i>, *
      in after days, was the devout proprietress; a few broken heads at the Bear
      Garden; the somewhat opposite sounds of the &ldquo;belles tolling for the
      lectorer, and the trumpets sounding to the stages,&rdquo; ** and sundry minor
      enormities, were the only terrible results of this national licence. Mark
      what followed, when masking, morris-dancing, ***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Foote's &ldquo;Minor.&rdquo; Act i. scene 1.

     ** Harleian MSS. No. 286.

     *** The morris-dance was one of the most applauded
     merriments of Old England. Robin Hood, Little John, Friar
     Tuck, Maid Marian, the Queen or Lady of the May, the fool,
     the piper, to which were afterwards added a dragon, and a
     hobbyhorse, were the characters that figured away in that
     truly ancient and grotesque movement. Will Kempe, &ldquo;the
     comical and conceited jest-monger, and vicegerent to the
     ghost of Dicke Tarleton,&rdquo; who &ldquo;raised many a roar by making
     faces and mouths of all sorts,&rdquo; danced the morris with his
     men of Gotham, in his &ldquo;Nine daies' wonder from London to
     Norwich.&rdquo; Kempe's &ldquo;new jigg,&rdquo; rivalled in popularity his
     Peter in Romeo and Juliet; Dogberry, in &ldquo;Much ado about
     nothing;&rdquo; and

     Justice Shallow, of which he was the original performer. In
     &ldquo;Jacke Drum's Entertainment,&rdquo; 4to. 1601, is the following
     song:

     ON THE INTRODUCTION OF A WHITSUN MORRIS-DANCE.

     &ldquo;Skip it and trip it nimbly, nimbly,
     Tickle it, tickle it lustily,
     Strike up the tabour for the wenches' favour,
     Tickle it, tickle it, lustily.
     Let us be seene on Hygate Greene,
     To dance for the honour of Holloway.
     Sing we are come hither, let us spare for no leather,
     To dance for the honour of Holloway.&rdquo;

      May games, stage-plays, * fairs, and the various pastimes that delighted
      the commonalty, were sternly prohibited. The heart sickens at the cant and
      cruelty of these monstrous times, when fanaticism, with a dagger in one
      hand, and &ldquo;<i>Hooks and Eyes for an Unbeliever's Breeches</i>,&rdquo; in the
      other, revelled in the destruction of all that was intellectual in the
      land.

     * Plays were suppressed by the Puritans in 1633. The actors
     were driven off the stage by the soldiers; and the only
     pleasantry that Messrs. &ldquo;Praise-God-Barebones&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fight-
     the-good-fight,&rdquo; indulged in, was  &ldquo;Enter red coat, exit hat
     and cloak;&rdquo; a cant phrase in reference to this devout
     tyranny. Randolph, in &ldquo;The Muses' Looking-glass,&rdquo; makes a
     fanatic utter this charitable prayer:

     &ldquo;That the Globe,
     Wherein (quoth he) reigns a whole world of vice,
     Had been consum'd, the Phoenix burnt to ashes;
     The Fortune whipp'd for a blind&mdash;Blackfriars!

     He wonders how it 'scap'd demolishing I' the time of
     Reformation: lastly, he wished The Bull might cross the
     Thames to the Bear Gardens, And there be soundly baited.

     In 1599 was published &ldquo;The overthrow of Stage Playes, by way
     of controversie betwixt D. Gager and D. Rainolde, where-
     in all the Reasons that ean be made for them are notably
     refuted, the objections answered, and the case so clear and
     resolved as that the judgment of any man that is not froward
     and perverse may casilic be satisfied; wherein is
     manifestly proved that it is not onely unlawfull to bee an
     actor, but a beholder of those vanities, &amp;e. &amp;c.&rdquo;

      When the lute, the virginals, the viol-de-gambo, were hushed for the
      inharmonious bray of their miserable conventicles, * and the quaintly
      appropriate signs ** of the ancient taverns and music shops were pulled
      down to make room for some such horrible effigy as we see dedicated to
      their high priest, <i>John Knox</i>, on a wall in the odoriferous
      Canongate of <i>Modern Athens</i>. ***

     * &ldquo;What a poor pimping business is a Presbyterian place of
     worship; dirty, narrow and squalid: stuck in the corner of
     an old Popish garden such as Linlithgow, and much more,
     Melrose.&rdquo;&mdash;Robert Burns.

     ** Two wooden heads, with this inscription under it: &ldquo;We
     three loggerheads be.&rdquo; The third was the spectator. The
     tabor was the ancient sign of a music shop. Tarleton kept an
     eating-house with this sign. Apropos of signs&mdash;Two Irishmen
     beholding a hatchment fixed against a house, the one
     inquired what it was? &ldquo;It's a bad sign!&rdquo; replied the other
     mysteriously. Paddy being still at fault as to the meaning,
     asked for further explanation.&mdash;&ldquo;It's a sign,&rdquo; cried his
     companion with a look of immeasurable superiority, &ldquo;that
     somebody is dead!&rdquo;

     *** Those who would be convinced of the profaneness of the
     Cameronians and Covenanters have only to read &ldquo;Scotch
     Presbyterian Eloquence displayed, or the Folly of their
     teaching discovered from their Books, Sermons, and Prayers,&rdquo;
      1738,&mdash;a volume full of ludicrous impieties. We select one
     specimen.

     Mr. William Vetch, preaching at Linton, in Tiviotdale, said,
     &ldquo;Our Bishops thought they were very secure this long time.

     &ldquo;Like Willie Willie Wastel,
     I am in my castel.
     All the dogs in the town
     Dare nor ding me down.

     &ldquo;Yea, but there is a doggie in Heaven that has dung them all

      Deep was the gloom of those dismal days! The kitchens were cool; the spits
      motionless. * The green holly and the mystic mistletoe ** were blooming
      abominations. The once rosy cheeks of John Bull looked as lean as a
      Shrove-Tuesday pancake, and every rib like the tooth of a saw.

     * &ldquo;The Lamentable Complaints of Nick Froth the Tapster, and
     Ruleroast the Cook,&rdquo; 4to. 1641.

     * The magical properties of the mistletoe are mentioned both
     by Virgil and Ovid; and Apuleius has preserved some verses
     of the poet Lelius, in which he mentions the mistletoe as
     one of the things necessary to make a magician. In the dark
     ages a similar belief prevailed, and even to the present day
     the peasants of Holstein, and some other countries, call the
     mistletoe the &ldquo;Spectre's Wand,&rdquo; from a supposition that
     holding a branch of mistletoe in the hand will not only
     enable a man to see ghosts, but to force them to speak to
     him! The mistletoe is peculiar to Christmas.

     And make the schoolmen flee;
     We'll down with all that smells of wit,

     ** The downfall of May-games, 4to. 1660. By Thomas Hall, the
     canting parson of King's-Norton.&mdash;Hear the caitiff,

     &ldquo;There's not a knave in all the town,
     Nor swearing courtier, nor base clown,
     Nor dancing lob, nor mincing quean,
     Nor popish clerk, be't priest or dean,
     Nor Knight debauch'd nor gentleman,
     That follows drab, or cup, or can,
     That will give thee a friendly look,
     If thou a May-pole canst not brook.&rdquo;

     On May 1, 1517, the unfortunate shaft, or May-pole, gave
     rise to the insurrection of that turbulent body, the London
     apprentices, and the plundering of the foreigners in the
     city, whence it got the name of Evil May-day. From that time
     the offending pole was hung on a range of hooks over the
     doors of a long row of neighbouring houses. In the 3rd of
     Edward VI. an over-zealous fanatic called Sir Stephen began
     to preach against this May-pole, which inflamed his audience
     so greatly, that the owner of every house over which it hung
     sawed off as much as depended over his premises, and
     committed piecemeal to the flames this terrible idol!

     The &ldquo;tall May-pole&rdquo; that &ldquo;onee o'erlooked the Strand,&rdquo;
      (about the year 1717,) Sir Isaac Newton begged of the
     parish, and it was carried to Wanstead in Essex, where it
     was erected in the park, and had the honour of raising the
     greatest telescope then known. The New Church occupies its
     site.

     &ldquo;But now (so Anne and piety ordain),
     A church collects the saints of Drury Lane.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and dancing! * For the disciples of <i>Stubbes</i> and <i>Prynne</i>
      having discovered by their sage oracles, that <i>May-games</i> were
      derived from the Floralian Feasts and interludes of the pagan Romans,
      which were solemnised on the first of May; and that dancing round a
      May-pole, adorned with garlands of flowers, ribbons, and other ornaments,
      was idolatry, after the fashion of Baal's worshippers, who capered about
      the altar in honour of their idol; resolved that the Goddess Flora should
      no longer receive the gratulations of Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, and Robin
      Hood's merry men, on a fine May morning; a superstition derived from the
      Sibyl's books, horribly papistical and pagan.

     * Sir Robert Howard has drawn an excellent picture of a
     Puritan family, in his comedy of &ldquo;The Committee.&rdquo; The
     personages are Mr. Day, chairman to the committee of
     sequestrations; Mrs. Day, &ldquo;the committee-man's utensil,&rdquo;
      with &ldquo;curled hair, white gloves, and Sabbath-day's cinnamon
     waistcoat;&rdquo; Abel, their booby son, a fellow &ldquo;whose heart is
     down in his breeches at every turn and Obadiah, chief clerk,
     dull, drawling, and heinously given to strong waters. We are
     admitted into the sanctum sanctorum, of pious fraud, where
     are seated certain honourable members, whose names cannot
     fail to enforce respect. Nehemiah Catch, Joseph Blemish,
     Jonathan Headstrong, and Ezekiel Scrape! The work of plunder
     goes bravely on. The robbing of widows and orphans is
     &ldquo;building up the new Zion.&rdquo; A parcel of notched rascals
     laying their heads together to cheat is &ldquo;the cause of the
     righteous prospering when brethren dwell together in unity
     and when a canting brother gives up lying and the ghost, Mr.
     Day remarks that &ldquo;Zachariah went off full of exhortation!&rdquo;

     It was at the sacking of Basing House, the seat of the
     venerable Marquis of Winchester, that Harrison, the regicide
     and butcher's son, shot Major Robinson, exclaiming as he did
     the deed, &ldquo;Cursed is he that doeth the work of the Lord
     negligently.&rdquo; Hugh Peters, the buffooning priest, was of the
     party.

     ** The erection of upright stone crosses is generally
     supposed to have dated its origin from the custom which the
     first Christians in this island adopted of inscribing the
     Druid stones with a cross, that the worship of the converted
     idolator might be transferred from the idol to the emblem of
     his faith; and afterwards the Saxon kings frequently erected
     crosses previously to a battle, at which public prayers were
     offered up for victory. After the Norman conquest crosses
     became common, and were erected in market-places, to induce
     honesty by the sanction of religion: in churchyards, to
     inspire devout and pious feelings; in streets, for the
     deposit of a corpse when borne to its last home; and for
     various other purposes. Here the beggar stationed himself,
     and asked alms in the name of Him who suffered on the cross.
     They were used for landmarks, that men might learn to
     respect and hold sacred the boundaries of another's
     property. Du Cange says that crosses were erected in the
     14th Richard II. as landmarks to define the boundaries
     between Kesteven and Holland. They were placed on public
     roads as a check to thieves, and to regulate processions. At
     the Reformation (?!! ) most of the crosses throughout the
     kingdom were destroyed, when the sweeping injunction of
     Bishop Horne was formally promulgated at his Visitation in
     1571, that all images of the Trinity in glass windows, or
     other places of the church, be put out and extinguished,
     together with the stone cross in the churchyard! We devoutly
     hope, as Dr. Johnson hoped of John Knox, that Bishop Horne
     was buried in a cross-road.

     toleration of prelacy&mdash;of the Protestant prelacy!&mdash;was the
     guilt of soul-murder. These were the merciful Christians!
     the sainted martyrs! who conducted the inquisitorial tyranny
     of the high commission, and imposed the test of that piece
     of impious buffoonery, the &ldquo;Holy League and Covenant!!&rdquo; who
     visited the west of Scotland with the free quarters of the
     military, and triumphed so brutally over the unfortunate,
     patriotic and gallant Montrose. The Scotch Presbyterians
     enacted that each episcopalian was liable to transportation
     who should baptize a child, or officiate as a clergyman to
     more than Jour persons, besides the members of his own

      &ldquo;A sad theme to a merry tune! But had not May <i>another</i> holiday
      maker? when the compassionate Mrs. Montague walked forth from her hall and
      bower to greet with a smile of welcome her grotesque visitor, the poor
      little sweep.&rdquo;

      Thy hand, Eugenio, for those gentle words! <i>Elia</i> would have taken
      thee to his heart. Be the turf that lies lightly on his breast as verdant
      as the bank whereon we sit. On a cold, dark, wintry morning, he had too
      often been disturbed out of a peaceful slumber by his shrill, mournful
      cry; and contrasting his own warm bed of down with the hard pallet from
      which the sooty little chorister had been driven at that untimely hour, he
      vented his generous indignation; and when a heart so tender as <i>Elia's</i>
      could feel indignation, bitter must have been the provocation and the
      crime! But the sweep, with his brilliant white teeth, and Sunday washed
      face, is for the most part a cheerful, healthy-looking being. Not so the
      squalid, decrepit <i>factory lad</i>, broken-spirited, overworked, and
      half-starved! The little sweep, in process of time, may become a master
      &ldquo;chum-mie,&rdquo; and have (without being obliged to sweep it,) a chimney of his
      own: but the factory lad sees no prospect of ever emerging from his
      heart-sickening toil and hopeless dependance; he feels the curse of Cain
      press heavily upon him. The little sweep has his merry May-day, with its
      jigs, rough music, gingling money-box, gilt-paper cocked-hat, and gay
      patchwork paraphernalia. All days are alike to the factory lad,&mdash;&ldquo;E'en
      Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to him.&rdquo; <i>His</i> rest will be the Sabbath
      of the tomb!

      He is the droning, horse-in-a-mill creature of habit,&mdash;like a certain
      old lady of our acquaintance, who every morning was the first up in the
      house, and good-for-nothing afterwards. A century ago the advantages of
      early rising to the citizen were far more numerous than at present. A
      brisk walk of ten minutes brought him into the fields from almost any part
      of the town; and after luxuriating three or four miles amidst clover,
      sorrel, buttercups, aye, and corn to boot! the fresh breeze of morn, the
      fragrance of the flowers, and the pleasant prospect, would inspire happy
      thoughts: and, as nothing better sharpens the appetite than these
      delightful companions, what was wanting but a substantial breakfast to
      prepare him for the business of the day? For this certain frugal houses of
      entertainment were established in the rural outskirts of the Metropolis, *

      those refreshing elements that &ldquo;cheer, but not inebriate;&rdquo; with the
      harmless addition of music and dancing. Ale, wine, and punch, were
      subsequently included in the bill of fare, and dramatic representations.
      But of latter years the town has walked into the country, and the citizen

      The north side of London was famous for suburban houses of entertainment.
      Midway down Gray's Inn Lane stands Town's End Lane (so called in the old
      maps), or Elm Street, which takes its name from some elms that once grew
      there. To the right is Mount Pleasant, and on its summit is planted a
      little hostelrie, which commanded a delightful prospect of fields, that
      are now annihilated; their site and our sight being profaned by the House
      of Correction and the Treadmill! Farther on, to the right, is Warner
      Street, which the lover of old English ballad poetry and music will never
      pass without a sigh; for there, while the town were applauding his
      dramatic drolleries,&mdash;and his beautiful songs charmed alike the
      humble and the refined,&mdash;their author, Henry Carey, in a fit of
      melancholy destroyed himself. *

      Close by stood the old Bath House, which was built over a <i>Cold Spring</i>
      by one Walter Baynes, in 1697. * The house is razed to the ground, but the
      spring remains. A few paces forward is the Lord Cobham's Head, **
      transmogrified into a modern temple for tippling; its shady gravel walks,
      handsome grove of trees, and green bowling alleys, are long since
      destroyed. Its opposite neighbour <i>was</i> (for not a vestige of the
      ancient building remains) the Sir John Oldcastle, *** where the wayfarer
      was invited to regale upon moderate terms.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * According to tradition, this was once the bath of Nell
     Gwynn. In Baynes's Row, close by, lived for many years the
     celebrated clown Joe Grimaldi.

     ** &ldquo;Sir,&mdash;Coming to my lodging in Islington, I called at the
     Lord Cobham's Head, in Cold Bath Fields, to drink some of
     their beer, which I had often heard to be the finest,
     strongest, and most pleasant in London, where I found a very
     handsome house, good accommodation, and pleasantly situated.
     I afterwards walked in the garden, where I was greatly
     surprised to find a very handsome grove of trees, with
     gravel walks, and finely illuminated, to please the company
     that should honour them with drinking a tankard of beer,
     which is threepence. There will be good attendance, and
     music of all sorts, both vocal and instrumental, and will
     begin this day, being the 10th of August.

     *** &ldquo;Sir,&mdash;A few days ago, invited by the serenity of the
     evening, I made a little excursion into the fields.
     Returning home, being in a gay humour, I stopt at a booth
     near Sir John Oldcastle's, to hear the rhetoric of Mr.
     Andrew. He used so much eloquence to persuade his auditors
     to walk in, that I (with many others) went to see his
     entertainment; and I never was more agreeably amused than
     with the performances of the three Bath Morris Dancers. They
     showed so many astonishing feats of strength and activity,
     so many amazing transformations, that it is impossible for
     the most lively imagination to form an adequate idea
     thereof. As the Fairs are coming on, I presume these
     admirable artists will be engaged to entertain the town; and
     I assure your readers they can't spend an hour more
     agreeably than in seeing the performances of these wonderful
     men.

     &ldquo;This evening, and during the Summer Season, will be
     performed several new exercises of Rope-dancing, Tumbling,
     Vaulting, Equilibres, Ladder-dancing, and Balancing, by Ma&mdash;
     dame Kerman, Sampson Rogetzi, Monsieur German, and Monsieur
     Dominique; with a new Grand Dance, called Apollo and Daphne,
     by Mr. Phillips, Mrs. Lebrune, and others; singing by Mrs.
     Phillips and Mrs. Jackson; likewise the extraordinary
     performance of Herr Von Eeekenberg, who imitates the lark,
     thrush, blackbird, goldfinch, canary-bird, flageolet, and
     German flute; a Sailor's Dance by Mr. Phillips; and Monsieur
     Dominique flies through a hogshead, and forces both heads
     out. To which will be added The Harlot's Progress. Harlequin
     by Mr. Phillips; Miss Kitty by Mrs. Phillips. Also, an exact
     representation of the late glorious victory gained over the
     French by the English at the battle of Dettingen, with the
     taking of the White Household Standard by the Scots Greys,
     and blowing up the bridge, and destroying and drowning most
     part of the French army. To begin every evening at five
     o'clock. Every one will be admitted for a pint of wine, as
     usual.&rdquo;

     Mahommed Caratha, the Grand Turk, performed here his
     &ldquo;Surprising Equilibres on the Slack Rope.&rdquo;

     In after years, the imitations of Herr Von Eeekenberg were
     emulated by James Boswell. (Bozzy!)

     &ldquo;A great many years ago, when Dr. Blair and I (Boswell) were
     sitting together in the pit of Drury Lane Playhouse, in a
     wild freak of youthful extravagance, I entertained the
     audience prodigiously by imitating the lowings of a cow. The
     universal cry of the galleries was, 'Encore the cow!' In the
     pride of my heart I attempted imitations of some other
     animals, but with very inferior effect. My revered friend,
     anxious for my fame, with an air of the utmost gravity and
     earnestness, addressed me thus, My dear sir, I would confine
     myself to the cow!'&rdquo;

     complaint against others who offer the like entertainments,
     that if the gentle zephyrs blow ever so little, the company

     ** These once beautiful tea-gardens (we remember them as

     * Farthing Pie Houses were common in the outskirts of London
     a century ago. Their fragrance caught the sharp set citizen

     feast on their savoury fare. One solitary Farthing Pie House
     (the Green Man) still stands near Portland Road, on the way
     to Paddington.

     ** Originally a chalybeate spring, then a music-house, and
     afterwards a &ldquo;theatre-royal!&rdquo; Cheesecakes, pipes, wine, and

      Compter,&rdquo; a comedy, by Thomas Jordan, 1641, the scene is laid at the

      Among its many by-gone houses of entertainment, the <i>Three Hats</i> has
      a double claim upon our notice. It was the arena where those celebrated
      masters, Johnson, ** Price, Sampson, *** and Coningham exhibited their
      feats of horsemanship, and the scene of Mr. Mawworm's early back-slidings.
      &ldquo;I used to go,&rdquo; (says that regenerated ranter to old Lady Lambert,) &ldquo;every
      Sunday evening to the Three Hats at Islington; it's a public house; mayhap
      your Ladyship may know it.

     thousand pounds by his engagements at home and abroad.

     intends to continue his performance during the summer

      Dobney's Jubilee Gardens (now entirely covered with mean hovels), Daniel

      entertainment might be found in this once merry village, &ldquo;a new booth,
      near Islington Turnpike,&rdquo; for tricks and mummery, was erected in September
      1767; &ldquo;an insignificant erection, calculated totally for the lowest
      classes, inferior artisans, superb apprentices, and journeymen.&rdquo;

     ** Animadvertor's letter to the Printer of the Daily
     Advertiser, 21st September 1767.

     *** August 22nd, 1770, Mr. Craven stated in an
     advertisement, that he had &ldquo;established rules for the
     strictest maintenance of order&rdquo; at the Pantheon. How far
     this was true, the following letter &ldquo;To the Printer of the
     St. James's Chronicle&rdquo; will show:&mdash;

     &ldquo;Sir,&mdash;Happening to dine last Sunday with a friend in the
     city, after coming from church, the weather being very
     inviting, we took a walk as far as Islington. In our return
     home towards Cold Bath Fields, we stepped in to view the
     Pantheon there; but such a scene of disorder, riot, and
     confusion, presented itself to me on my entrance, that I was
     just turning on my heel in order to quit it, when my friend
     observing that we might as well have something for our money
     (for the doorkeeper obliged each of us to deposit a tester
     before he granted us admittance), I acquiesced in his
     proposal, and became one of the giddy multitude. I soon,
     however, repented of my choice; for, besides having our
     sides almost squeezed together, we were in danger every
     minute of being scalded by the boiling water which the
     officious Mercuries were circulating with the utmost
     expedition through their respective districts. We therefore
     began to look out for some place to sit down in, which with
     the greatest difficulty we at length procured, and producing
     our tickets, were served with twelve-penny worth of punch.
     Being seated towards the front of one of the galleries, I
     had now a better opportunity of viewing this dissipated
     scene. The male part of the company seemed to consist
     chiefly of city apprentices and the lower class of
     tradesmen. The ladies, who constituted by far the greater
     part of the assembly, seemed most of them to be pupils of
     the Cyprian goddess, and I was sometimes accosted with,
     'Pray, sir, will you treat me with a dish of tea?' Of all
     the tea-houses in the environs of London, the most
     exceptionable that I have had occasion to be in is the
     Pantheon.

      punch, &amp;c., a &ldquo;tester&rdquo; being the price of admission to the promenade
      and galleries. It was eventually turned to a very different use, and
      converted into a lay chapel by the late Countess of Huntingdon.

     Dalby Terrace, Islington) was famous for duck-hunting, bull-
     baiting, and other low sports. &ldquo;On Wednesday last, two women
     fought for a new shift valued at half-a-guinea, in the Spaw-
     Fields near Islington. The battle was won by a woman called
     Bruising Peg, who beat her antagonist in a terrible
     manner.&rdquo;&mdash;22nd June 1768.

      But by far the most interesting ancient hostelrie that has submitted to
      the demolishing mania for improvement is the <i>Old Queen's Head</i>,
      formerly situate in the Lower Street, Islington. This stately edifice was
      one of the most perfect specimens of ancient domestic architecture in
      England. Under its venerable roof Sir Walter Raleigh, it is said, &ldquo;puffed
      his pipe;&rdquo; and might not Jack Falstaff have taken his ease there, when he
      journeyed to string a bow with the Finsbury archers? For many years it was
      a pleasant retreat for retired citizens, who quaffed their nut-brown
      beneath its primitive porch, and indulged in reminiscences of the olden
      time. Thither would little Quick, King George the Third's favourite actor,
      resort to drink cold punch, and &ldquo;babble&rdquo; of his theatrical contemporaries.
      Plays * were formerly acted there.

      On Monday, October 19, 1829, it was razed to the ground, to make room for
      a misshapen mass of modern masonry. The oak parlour has been preserved
      from the wreck, and is well worth a visit from the antiquary. Canonbury
      Tavern and Highbury Barn still maintain their festive honours. Farther
      a-field are the Sluice, or Eel-pie House; Copenhagen House; Hornsey-wood
      House, formerly the hunting seat of Queen Elizabeth; Chalk Farm; Jack
      Straw's Castle; the Spaniards, &amp;c. as yet undefiled by pitiful
      prettinesses of bricks and mortar, and affording a delightful opportunity
      of enjoying pure air and pastime. The canonised Bishop of Lichfield and
      Mademoiselle St. Agnes have each their wells. What perambulator of the

     ** &ldquo;At Edward Martin's, at the Hornes at Pancrass, is that
     excellent water, highly approved of by the most eminent phy-
     sitians, and found by long experience to be a powerful
     antidote against rising of the vapours, also against the
     stone and gravel. It likewise cleanses the body, purifies
     and sweetens the blood, and is a general and sovereign help
     to nature. I shall open on Whitson-Monday, the 24th of May
     1697; and there will be likewise dancing every Tuesday and
     Thursday all the summer season at the place aforesaid. The
     poor may drink the waters gratis.&rdquo; Then follow sixteen lines
     of rhyme in praise of &ldquo;this noble water,&rdquo; and inviting
     ladies and gentlemen to drink of it. Of this rare hand-bill
     no other copy is known.

     &ldquo;And although this place (Paneras) be as it were forsaken of
     all, and true men seldome frequent the same but upon de-vyne
     occasions, yet is it visyted and usually haunted of roages,
     vagabondes, harlettes and theeves, who assemble not ther to
     pray, but to wayte for praye, and manie fall into their

      As population increased, houses of entertainment multiplied to meet the

     *  &ldquo;Star and Garter Tavern, Chelsea, 1763. Mr. Lowe will
     display his uncommon abilities with watches, letters, rings,
     swords, cards, and enchanted clock, which absolutely tells
     the thoughts of any person in the company. The astonishing
     Little Man, only four inches high, pays his respects to the
     company, and vanishes in a flash of fire. Mr. Lowe commands
     nine lighted candles to fly from the table to the top of the
     ceiling! Added, a grand entertainment, with musick and
     dancing, &amp;c. &amp;c.&rdquo;

     ** The great attraction of Don Saltero's Coffeehouse was its
     collection of rarities, a catalogue of which was published
     as a guide to the visitors. It comprehends almost every
     description of curiosity, natural and artificial. &ldquo;Tigers'
     tusks; the Pope's candle; the skeleton of a Guinea-pig; a
     fly-cap monkey; a piece of the true Cross; the Four
     Evangelists' heads cut on a cherry-stone; the King of
     Morocco's tobacco-pipe;

     Mary Queen of Scot's pincushion; Queen Elizabeth's prayer-
     book; a pair of Nun's stockings; Job's ears, which grew on a
     tree; a frog in a tobacco stopper,&rdquo; and five hundred more
     odd relies! The Don had a rival, as appears by &ldquo;A Catalogue
     of the Rarities to be seen at Adams's, at the Royal Swan, in
     Kingsland Road, leading from Shoreditch Church, 1756.&rdquo; Mr.
     Adams exhibited, for the entertainment of the curious, &ldquo;Miss
     Jenny Cameron's shoes; Adam's eldest daughter's hat; the
     heart of the famous Bess Adams, that was hanged at Tyburn
     with Lawyer Carr, January 18, 1736-7; Sir Walter Raleigh's
     tobacco-pipe; Vicar of Bray's clogs; engine to shell green
     pease with; teeth that grew in a fish's belly; Black Jack's
     ribs; the very comb that Abraham combed his son Isaac and
     Jacob's head with; Wat Tyler's spurs; rope that cured
     Captain Lowry of the head-ach, ear-ach, tooth-ach and belly-
     ach; Adam's key of the fore and back door of the Garden of
     Eden, &amp;e. &amp;e.&rdquo; These are only a few out of five hundred
     others equally marvellous. Is this strange catalogue a quiz

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Rotunda was first opened on the 5th of April, 1742,
     with a public breakfast. At Ranelagh House (Gentleman's
     Magazine for 1767) on the 12th of May, were performed the
     much-admired catches and glees, selected from the curious
     collection of the Catch Club; being the first of the kind
     publickly exhibited in this or any other kingdom. The
     entertainment consisted of the favourite catches and glees,
     composed by the most eminent masters of the last and present
     age, by a considerable number of the best vocal and
     instrumental performers. The choral and instrumental parts
     were added, to give the catches and glees their proper
     effect in so large an amphitheatre; being composed for that
     purpose by Dr. Arne. The Masquerades at Ranelagh are
     represented in Fielding's &ldquo;Amelia&rdquo; as dangerous to morals,
     and the &ldquo;Connoisseur&rdquo; satirises their Eve-like beauties with
     caustic humour.

      others, bear testimony to the growing spirit of national jollity during a

     beauties of these gardens would indeed require as much
     pains, and as much paper too, as to rehearse all the good
     actions of their master; whose life proves the truth of an
     observation which I have read in some other writer, that a
     truly elegant taste is generally accompanied with an
     excellency of heart; or in other words, that true virtue is
     indeed nothing else but true taste.&rdquo; Amelia, b. ix. c. ix.

      never hit upon a happier subject than the humours of Cockneyland. &ldquo;Man
      made the town and a pretty sample it is of the maker! Behind or before the
      counter, at home and abroad, the man of business or the beau, the Cockney
      is the same whimsical original, baffling imitation, and keeping
      description in full cry. See him sally forth on a fine Sunday to inhale
      his weekly mouthful of fresh air, * the world all before him, where to
      choose occupying his meditations, till he finds himself elevated on
      High-gate Hill or Hampstead Heath. From those magnificent summits he
      beholds in panorama, woods, valleys, lofty trees, and stately turrets, not
      forgetting that glorious cupola dedicated to the metropolitan saint, which
      points out the locality where, six days out of the seven, his orisons are
      paid to a deity not contemplated by the apostle.

      He lays himself out for enjoyment, and seeks good entertainment for man
      and (if mounted, or in his cruelty-van) for horse. Having taken possession
      of a window that commands the best prospect, the waiter is summoned, the
      larder called over, the ceremony of lunch commenced, and, with that
      habitual foresight which marks his character, the all-important meal that
      is to follow, duly catered for. The interval for rural adventure arrives;
      he takes a stroll; the modest heath-bell and the violet turn up their dark
      blue eyes to him; and he finds blackberries enough (as Falstaff's men did
      <i>linen!</i>) on every hedge. Dinner served up, and to his mind, he warms
      and waxes cosey, jokes with the waiter, talks anything, and to anybody,

      pleased with himself, and willing to please. If his phraseology provoke a
      laugh, he puts it to the account of his smart sayings, and is loudest in
      the chorus; for when the ball of ridicule is flying about, he ups with his
      racket and strikes it off to his neighbour.

      He is the worst mortal in the world to be put out of his way. The
      slightest inconvenience, the most trifling departure from his wonted
      habits, he magnifies into a serious evil. His well-stocked larder and
      cheerful fireside are ever present to his view: beef and pudding have
      taken fast hold of him; and, in default of these, his spirits flag; he is
      hipped and melancholy. Foreign travel exhibits him in his natural light;
      his peculiarities break forth with whimsical effect, which, though not
      always the most amiable, are nevertheless entertaining. He longs to see
      the world; and having with due ceremony arranged his wardrobe, put money
      in his purse, and procured his passport to strange lands, he sets forward,
      buttoned up in his native consequence, to the capital of the grand
      monarque, to rattle dice, and drink champagne. His expectations are not
      the most reasonable. Without considering the different manners and customs
      of foreign parts, he bends to nobody, yet takes it as an affront if
      everybody bend not to him! His baggage is subjected to rigorous search.
      The infernal <i>parlez-vous!</i>&mdash;nothing like <i>this</i> ever
      happens in old England! His passport is inspected, and his person
      identified. The inquisitors!&mdash;to take the length and breadth of a
      man, his complexion and calling! The barriers are closed, and he must <i>bivouac</i>
      in the Diligence the live-long night. Monstrous tyranny! Every rogue
      enjoys free ingress and egress in a land of liberty! He calls for the bill
      of fare, the &ldquo;<i>carte</i>,&rdquo; and in his selection puts the cart before the
      horse! Of course there is a horrible conspiracy to poison him! The wines,
      too, are sophisticated. The champagne is gooseberry; the Burgundy, Pontac;
      and the <i>vin ordinaire</i> neither better nor worse than a dose of
      &ldquo;Braithwait's Intermediate.&rdquo; The houses are dirty and dark; the streets
      muddy and gay; the madames and mademoiselles pretty well, I thank'e; and
      the Mounseers a pack of chattering mountebanks, stuck over with little
      bits of red ribbon, and blinded with snuff and whiskers! Even the air is
      too thin: he misses his London smoke! And but one drunken dog has he
      encountered (and <i>he</i> was his countryman!) to bring to fond
      remembrance the land we live in! * What wonder, then, if he sigh for
      luxurious bachelorship in a Brighton boarding-house? Beds made, dinner

      incidental to good living set before him, without the annoyance of idle
      servants, and the trouble of ordering, leaving him to the delightful
      abandonment of every care, save that of feasting and pleasure-taking!

      With moderate gastronomical and soporific powers, he may manage to eat,
      drink, and sleep out three guineas a-week; for the sea is a rare
      provocative to feeding and repose. Besides, a Brighton boarding-house is a
      change both of air and condition; bachelors become Benedicks, and widows
      wives, for three guineas a-week, more or less! It furnishes an extensive
      assortment of acquaintance, such as nowhere else can be found domiciled
      under the same roof. Each finds it necessary to make himself and herself
      agreeable. Pride, <i>mauvaise honte</i>, modesty? that keep people apart
      in general society, all give way. The inmates are like one family; and
      when they break up for the season, 'tis often in pairs!

      &ldquo;Uncle Timothy to a T! Pardon me, sir, but he must have sat to you for the
      portrait. If you unbutton his native consequence a little, and throw a
      jocular light over his whim-whams and caprices, the likeness would be
      perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was addressed to us by a lively, well-to-do-in-the-world-looking
      little gentleman, who lolled in an arm-chair opposite to an adjoining
      window, taking things in an easy pick-tooth way, and coquetting with a
      pint of old port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The picture, sir, that you are pleased to identify is not an individual,
      but a species,&mdash;a slight off-hand sketch, taken from general
      observation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! That's odd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never knew Uncle Tim was like all the world. Would, for all the world's
      sake, that all the world were like Uncle Tim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A worthy character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, he holds in his heart all the four honours,&mdash;Truth, Honesty,
      Affection, and Benevolence,&mdash;in the great game of humanity, and plays
      not for lucre, but love! I fear you think me strangely familiar,&mdash;impertinent
      too, perhaps. But that portrait, so graphical and complete, was a spell as
      powerful as Odin's to break silence. Besides, I detest your exclusives,&mdash;sentimentalising!
      soliloquising!&mdash;Their shirt-collars, affectedly turned down, puts my
      choler up! Give <i>me</i> the human face divine, the busy haunts of men,
      the full tide of human existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little gentleman translated the &ldquo;full tide&rdquo; into a full glass to our
      good healths and better acquaintance, at the same time drawing his chair
      nearer, and presenting a handsomely embossed card, on which was inscribed,
      in delicate Italian calligraphy, &ldquo;Mr. Benjamin Bosky, Dry-salter, Little
      Britain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Drysalter</i>,&mdash;he looked like a thirsty soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant prospect from this window; you may count every steeple in
      London. There's the 'tall bully,'&mdash;how gloriously his flaming
      top-knot glistens in the setting sun! Wouldn't give a fig for the best
      view in the world, if it didn't take in the dome of St. Paul's! Beshrew
      the Vandal architect that cut down those beautiful elms.&mdash;

      proprietors from their propriety and port!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that Mr. Bosky was not to be so frightened; for he drew
      another draught on his pint decanter, though sitting beneath the umbrage
      of a huge pair of antlers that were fixed against the wall, under which
      innumerable Johnny New-comes had been sworn, according to ancient custom,
      at the Horns at Highgate. It was equally clear, too, that Mr. Bosky <i>himself</i>
      might have sat for the portrait that he had so kindly appropriated to
      Uncle Timothy.

      A fine manly voice without was heard to troll with joyous melody,&mdash;

      &ldquo;Uncle Tim! Uncle Tim!&rdquo; shouted the mercurial little Drysalter, and up he
      started as if he had been galvanised, scampered out of the room, made but
      one leap from the top of the stairs to the bottom, descended <i>à plomb</i>,
      was up again before we had recovered from our surprise, and introduced a
      middle-aged, rosy-faced gentleman, &ldquo;more fat than bard beseems,&rdquo; with a
      perforating eye and a most satirical nose. &ldquo;Uncle Timothy, gentlemen.&mdash;A
      friend or two, (if I may presume to call them so,) Uncle Timothy, that I
      have fallen in with most unexpectedly and agreeably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a certain &ldquo;I no <i>not</i> like thee, <i>Doctor Fell</i>,&rdquo;
       feeling, and an &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; that have rarely deceived us. With the latter, the
      satirical-nosed gentleman inspired us at first sight. There was the
      humorist, with a dash of the antiquary, heightened with a legible
      expression that nature sometimes stamps on her higher order of
      intelligences. What a companion, we thought, for &ldquo;<i>Round about our coal
      fire</i>&rdquo; on a winter's evening, or, &ldquo;<i>Under the green-wood tree</i>&rdquo; on
      a summer's clay!
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all soon very good company; and half a dozen tea-totallers, who
      had called for a pint of ale and six glasses, having discussed their long
      division and departed, we had the room to ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know you, Uncle Timothy,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bosky, with a serio-comic air, &ldquo;that
      the law against vagabonds and sturdy beggars is in full force, seeing that
      you carol in broad daylight, and on the King's highway, a loose catch
      appertaining to one of the most graceless of their fraternity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beggars! varlet! I beg nothing of thee but silence, which is gold, if
      speech be silver. * Is there aught unseemly in my henting the stile with
      the merry Autolycus? Vagabonds! The order is both ancient and honourable.

      steal. Better lose my purse than my patience. Thou, scapegrace! rob best
      me of my patience, and beggest nought but the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were not the beggars once a jovial crew, sir?&rdquo; addressing ourselves to
      the middle-aged gentleman with the satirical nose.

      &ldquo;The joys of to-day were never marred by the cares of to-morrow; for
      to-morrow was left to take care of itself; and its sun seldom went down
      upon disappointment. The beggar, * though his pockets be so low, that you
      might dance a jig in one of them without breaking your shins against a
      halfpenny; while from the other you might be puzzled to extract as much
      coin as would pay turnpike for a walking-stick, sings with a light heart;
      his fingers no less light! playing administrators to the farmer's poultry,

          Who's so happy a king as he?
          At the crowning of our king,
          Thus we ever dance and sing.
          Where's the nation lives so free
          And so merry as do we?
          Be it peace, or be it war,
          Here at liberty we are.
          Hang all Harmanbccks! we cry,
          And the Cuffinquiers, too, by.
          We enjoy our ease and rest,
          To the fields we are not press'd;
          When the subsidy's increas'd,
          We are not a penny cost;
          Nor are we called into town
          To be troubled with a gown;
          Nor will any go to law
          With a beggar for a straw.
          All which happiness he brags
          He doth owe unto his rags!&rdquo;

     Of all the mad rascals that belong to this fraternity, the
     <i>Abraham-Man</i> is the most fantastic. He calls himself by
     the name of <i>Poor Tom</i>, and, coming near to any one, cries
     out &ldquo;Poor Tom's a-cold!&rdquo; Some are exceedingly merry, and do
     nothing but sing songs, fashioned out of their own brains;
     some will dance; others will do nothing but laugh or weep;
     others are dogged, and so sullen, both in look and speech,
     that, spying but small company in a house, they boldly
     enter, compelling the servants, through fear, to give them
     what they demand, which is commonly something that will
     yield ready money. The &ldquo;<i>Upright Man</i>&rdquo; (who in ancient times
     was, next to the king and those &ldquo;o' th' blood,&rdquo; in dignity,)
     is not a more terrible enemy to the farmer's poultry than
     Poor Tom.

     How finely has Shakspeare spiritualized this strange
     character in the part of Edgar in King Lear!

     The middle aisle of old St. Paul's was a great resort for
     beggars.

          &ldquo;In Paul's Church, by a pillar,
          Sometimes ye have me stand, sir,
          With a writ that shews
          What care and woes
          I pass by sea and land, sir.
          With a seeming bursten belly,
          I look like one half dead, sir,
          Or else I beg With a wooden leg,
          And with a night-cap on my head, sir.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;A MIRTHFUL PAGEANT OF THE BULL-FEATHERS TO THE HORNS AT HIGHGATE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ancient brethren of Bull-Feathers-Hall were a club of warm citizens;
      'rich fellows enough! fellows that have had losses, with everything
      handsome about them.' Their place of rendezvous was the Chequer-Yard in
      Whitechapel, every Tuesday and Thursday at seven o'clock. The intent of
      their meeting was to solace themselves with harmless merriment, and
      promote good fellowship * among neighbours.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * How good fellowship had declined a century before this
     will be seen by the following extract from a black-letter
     ballad, intituled, &ldquo;A balade declaryng how neybourhed loue,
     and trew dealyng is gone. Imprinted at London by Richard
     Lant.&rdquo; (Circa 1560.)

          &ldquo;Where shall one fynde a man to trust,
          Alwaye to stande in tyme of neede;
          Thee most parte now, they are unjust,
          Fayre in wordes, but false in deede:
          Neybourhed nor loue is none,
          True dealyng now is fled and gone.&rdquo;

      The president, arrayed in his crimson satin gown, with his cap furred and
      surmounted by a pair of antlers, and seated in a chair of state beneath a
      canopy, commanded (by the crier of the court) every member to be covered;
      and in the twinkling of an eye their horns were exalted. On a velvet
      cushion before him lay the comuted sceptre and sword. The brethren drank
      out of horn-cups, and made oath upon a book of statutes bound in horn.
      Their revenues were derived from a toll upon all the gravel carried up
      Highgate Hill and Hornsey;&mdash;Cow-lane; and beyond sea, Crook-horn;
      Leg-horn; and Ox-mantown paying them yearly tribute! On Monday, the 2nd
      May, 1664, a deputation of the fraternity met at <i>Busby's Folly</i>, *
      near Sadler's Wells, ** Islington, from whence they marched in grand
      order, headed by their Captain of Pioneers, with between thirty and forty
      of his men, with pick-axes and spades to level the hill, and baskets to
      carry the gravel;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A print of Busbys Folly occurs in a rare volume, called
     &ldquo;Views of divers noted places near London, 1731,&rdquo; of which
     Gough, the antiquary never saw hut one copy. Its site is
     particularly pointed out in Ogilby's map of London to
     Holyhead.

     * &ldquo;Sadler's Wells being lately opened, there is likely to be
     a great resort of strolling damsels, half-pay officers,
     peripatetic tradesmen, tars, butchers, and others, musically
     inclined.&rdquo;&mdash;Weekly Journal, 16th March 1718.

     It is curious to read at the bottom of the old bills and
     advertisements of Sadler's Wells the following <i>alarming</i>
     announcements:&mdash;&ldquo;A <i>horse patrol</i> will be sent in the New
     Road that night for the <i>protection</i> of the nobility and
     gentry who go from the squares and that end of the town. The
     road also towards the city will be properly <i>guarded</i>.&rdquo;

     &ldquo;June 1783. <i>Patroles of horse and foot</i> are stationed from
     Sadler's Wells' gate along the New Road to Tottenham Court
     turnpike; likewise from the City Road to Moorfields; also to
     St. John Street, and across the Spafields to Rosoman Row,
     from the hours of eight to eleven.&rdquo;

      After which followed the standard, an enormous pair of horns mounted on a
      lofty pole, borne by three officers, and attended by the master of the
      ceremonies, the mace-bearer, the herald at-arms, the sword-bearer and the
      crier, their footsteps keeping time to a flourish of trumpets and horns. *

     *  &ldquo;On Tuesday next, being Shrove Tuesday, there will be a
     fine <i>hog bar-byqu'd</i> whole, at the house of Peter Brett, at
     the Rising Sun, in Islington Road, with other diversions.&mdash;
     Note. It is the house where the ox was roasted whole at
     Christmas last.&rdquo; Mist's Journal, Feb. 9, 1726.

     A hog barbecu'd is a West Indian term, and means a hog
     roasted whole, stuffed with spice, and basted with Madeira
     wine. Oldfield, an eminent glutton of former days,
     gormandised away a fortune of fifteen hundred pounds a-year.
     Pope thus alludes to him,&mdash;

     &ldquo;Oldfield, with more than harpy throat endu'd,
     Cries, 'Send me, gods, a whole hog barbecu'd!'&rdquo;

     &ldquo;On Thursday next, being 13th March 1718, the Bowling-
     Greens will be opened at the Prospect House, Islington,
     where there will be accommodation for all gentlemen
     bowlers.&rdquo;

     Bowling-greens were among the many amusements of Merrie
     England. The author of &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; established a
     bowling-green in the village confided to his pastoral care,
     for innocent and healthful recreation.

     &ldquo;True piety is cheerful as the day.&rdquo;

     &ldquo;May 1757. To be bowl'd for on Monday next, at the Red Cow,
     in St. George's Fields, a pair of Silver Buckles, value
     fourteen shillings, at five pins, each pin a yard apart. He
     that brings most pins at three bowls has the buckles, if the
     money is in; if not, the money each man has put in. Three
     bowls for sixpence, and a pint of beer out of it, for the
     good of the house,&rdquo;

    <p>
      Arriving near the Gate-house&mdash;(gentlemen, we are within a few yards
      of the <i>very spot!</i>)&mdash;the viceroy of the gravel-pits went forth
      to meet them, presenting the horn of plenty as a token of hearty welcome;
      and passing through the gate, they made a circuit round the old pond, and
      returning to their starting-post, one of the brethren delivered a poetical
      oration, humorously descriptive of Bull-Feathers-Hall, and expatiating on
      the antiquity and dignity of horns. The speech being ended, they paraded
      to the dinner-table, which groaned under every luxury of the season. There
      they regaled themselves, amidst the sounding of trumpets and the winding
      of horns. Between dinner and dessert, those of the officers who had
      singing faces volunteered a festive chant, in which the whole company
      joined chorus.

      Any candidate desirous of being admitted a member of the fraternity was
      proposed by the sword-bearer; and the master of the ceremonies placing him
      in the adopting chair, the comptroller made three ejaculations, upon which
      the brethren doffed their hats. Then the master of the ceremonies
      exchanged his own comuted castor for a cap, and administered to his newly
      elected brother, on a book horned on all sides, an oath in rhyme,
      recapitulating a long string of duties belonging to their peculiar art and

      half-sulky mouth. As a last determined effort, he shook his <i>head</i> at
      Mr. Bosky, whereupon Mr. Bosky shook his <i>hand</i>. The mutual grasp was
      electrical, and thus ended the brief farce of Uncle Timothy's furor.

      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Bosky, in a subdued tone, &ldquo;if I could believe that
      Uncle Timothy had been really in earnest, my penitential punch should be
      turned into bitter aloes, sweetened with assafoetida, to expiate an
      offence against the earliest, best, and dearest friend I ever knew! But I
      owed Uncle Timothy a revenge. Of late he has worn a serious brow, a
      mournful smile. There has been melancholy in his mirth, and sadness in his
      song; this, he well knows, cuts me to the quick; and it is not until he is
      angry,&mdash;or, rather&rdquo; (smiling affectionately at Uncle Tim) &ldquo;until he
      <i>thinks</i> himself so,&rdquo;&mdash;(here Uncle Tim gave Mr. Bosky one of his

      &ldquo;A precocious young urchin, gentlemen, in every sort of mischief!&rdquo;
       interrupted Uncle Timothy with nervous impetuosity, &ldquo;on whose

      &ldquo;You see, my good friends,&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy, after a short pause, &ldquo;that
      the rogue is incorrigible! But Benjamin Bosky&rdquo;&mdash;(here Uncle Tim tried
      to look sententious, and adopted the <i>bowwow</i> style)&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot
      but blush, deeply blush for thy morals, or rather, Benjamin Bosky, for thy
      no-morals, when thou canst thus blurt thy flattery in my face, because I
      simply did a duty that kindred imposed upon me, and the sweet
      consciousness of performing made light and pleasant.

      &ldquo;Tom-tits! Benjamin Bosky, tom-tits!&rdquo;

      MR. BOSKY'S L'ENVOY,=
    </h3>
    <p class="indent10">
      From childhood he rear'd me, how fondly my heart
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Forgets not, nor lets not my tongue silent be;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But whispers, while sweet tears of gratitude start,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A blessing and pray'r for his kindness to me!

    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent10">
      I'll breathe not his name, though its record is deep

    </p>

      The conversation now took a more lively turn. Mr. Bosky fired off his
      jokes right and left; and if there be truth in physiognomy, the animated
      countenance of Uncle Timothy beamed with complacency and joy. He was in
      full song, and showered forth his wit and eloquence in glorious profusion,
      beauty following upon beauty. Thus another Attic hour glided imperceptibly
      away. The midnight chimes at length admonished us to depart. A galaxy of
      stars had risen in the unclouded firmament, and a refreshing air breathed
      around. And as we had many times during the evening filled <i>our</i>
      horns, the harvest moon had filled <i>hers</i> also to light us home.

      As antiquaries, we have a reverence for dancing. Noah danced before the
      ark. The boar's head and the wine and wassail were crowned with a dance to
      the tune of '<i>The Black Almayne,' 'My Lorde Marques Galyarde,' and 'The
      firste Traces of due Passa.'</i>

      &ldquo;The innocent and the happy, while the dews of youth are upon them, dance

      &ldquo;Haydn used to say that without melody the most learned and singular
      combinations are but unmeaning, empty sound. What but the simplicity and
      tenderness of the Scotch and Irish airs constitutes their charm? This
      great composer was so extravagantly fond of Scotch, Irish, and Welsh
      melodies, that he harmonised many of them, and had them hung up in frames
      in his room. We remember to have heard somewhere of an officer in a
      Highland regiment, who was sent with a handful of brave soldiers to a
      penal settlement in charge of a number of convicts; the Highlanders grew
      sick at heart; the touching strains of '<i>Lochaber nae mair</i>.' heard
      far from home, made them so melancholy, that the officer in command
      forbade its being played by the band.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, likewise, with the national melody, the '<i>Rans-des-Vaches</i>' among
      the Swiss mountaineers. When sold by their despotic chiefs, and torn from
      their dearest connexions, suicide and desertion were so frequent when this
      melody was played, that orders were issued in all their regiments,
      prohibiting any one from playing an air of that kind on pain of death. <i>La
      maladie du pays</i>,&mdash;that sickening after home! But Handel's music
      has received more lasting and general applause than that of any other
      composer. By Boyce and Battishall his memory was adored; Mozart was
      enthusiastic in his praise; Haydn could not listen (<i>who can?</i>) to
      his glorious Messiah * without weeping; and Beethoven has been heard to
      declare, that were he ever to come to England he should uncover his head,
      and kneel down at his tomb!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Bishop Ken says,

          &ldquo;Sweet music with blest poesy began,
          Congenial both to angels and to Man,
          Song was the native language to rehearse
          The elevations of the soul in verse:
          And through succeeding ages, all along,
          Saints praised the Godhead in devoted song.&rdquo;

     And he adds in plain prose, that the Garden of Eden was no
     stranger to &ldquo;singing and the voice of melody.&rdquo; Jubal was the
     &ldquo;father of those who handled the harp and organ.&rdquo; Long-
     before the institution of the Jewish church, God received
     praise both by the human voice and the &ldquo;loud timbrel and
     when that church was in her highest prosperity, King David
     seems to have been the composer of her psalmody&mdash;both poetry
     and music. He occupied the orchestra of the temple, and
     accounted it a holy privilege &ldquo;to play before the Lord&rdquo; upon
     &ldquo;the harp with a solemn sound.&rdquo; Luther said, &ldquo;I verily think
     that, next to divinity, no art is comparable to music.&rdquo;

     And what a glorious specimen of this divine art is his
     transcendant &ldquo;Hymn!&rdquo; breathing the most awful grandeur, the
     deepest pathos, the most majestic adoration! The Puritans&mdash;
     devils and Puritans hate music&mdash;are piously economical in
     their devotions, and eschew the principle &ldquo;not to give unto
     the Lord that which costs us nothing!&rdquo; Their gift is
     snuffled through the &ldquo;vocal nose&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;O most sweet voices!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessings on the memory of the bard, * and 'Palms eternal flourish round
      his urn,' who first struck his lyre to celebrate the wooden walls of
      unconquered and unconquerable Merrie England! If earth hide him,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      'May angels with their silver wings o'ershade
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      The ground, now sacred by his reliques made
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

      if ocean cover him, calm be the green wave on its surface! May his spirit

      cave of the deep and silent sea!&rdquo;

     * A few old amateurs of music and mirth may possibly
     remember Collins's Evening Brush, that rubbed off the rust
     of dull care from the generation of 1790. His bill comprised
     &ldquo;Actors of the old school and actors of the new; tragedy
     tailors, and butchers in heroics; bell-wethers in buskins,
     wooden actors, petticoat caricatures, lullaby jinglers,
     bogglers and blunderers, buffoons in blank-verse, &amp;c. &amp;c.&rdquo;
      The first of the three Dibdins opened a shop of merriment at
     the Sans Souci, where he introduced many of his beautiful
     ballads, and sang them to his own tunes. The navy of England
     owe lasting obligations to this harmonious Three. It
     required not the aid of poetry and music (and how
     exquisitely has Shield set the one to the other!) to
     stimulate our gallant seamen; but it needed much to awaken
     and keep alive enthusiasm on shore, and elevate their moral
     character&mdash;for landsmen &ldquo;who live at home at ease/' were
     wont to consider the sailor as a mere tar-barrel, a sea-
     monster. How many young bosoms have been inspired by the
     lyrics of the three Dibdins! What can surpass the homely
     pathos of &ldquo;I thought my heart would break when I sang, Yo!
     heave O!&rdquo;

     &ldquo;The Last Whistle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom
     Bowling!&rdquo; stirring the manly heart like the sound of a
     trumpet! It is wise to infuse the amorpatriæ into popular
     amusements; national songs work wonders among the million.
     In Little Russia, no sooner are the postilions mounted for a
     journey, than they begin to hum a patriotic air, which often
     continues for hours without intermission. The soldiers sing
     during a long and fatiguing march; the peasant lightens his
     labour in the same manner; and in a still evening the air
     vibrates with the cheerful songs of the surrounding
     villages.

      Vauxhall. We pass over the good knight's religious horror at beholding
      what a few steeples rose on the west of Temple-Bar; and the waterman's

      exquisitely pleasant at this time of the year. When I considered the
      fragrancy of the walks and bowers, with the choir of birds that sang upon
      the trees, and the loose tribe of people that walked under their shades, I
      could not but look upon the place as a kind of Mahometan paradise. Sir
      Roger told me it put him in mind of a little coppice by his house in the
      country, which his chaplain used to call an aviary of nightingales.' &ldquo;And

          At night such new vagaries,
          Such gay and harmless sport;
          All look'd like giant fairies,

          As skylarks sweet I hear;
          The sounds I'm still enjoying,
          They 'll always soothe my ear.
          Here paintings, sweetly glowing,
          Where'er our glances fall,
          Here colours, life bestowing,
          Bedeck this green-wood hall!
          The king there dubs a farmer,
          There John his doxy loves;*

          Odzooks! a man of stone.

          Not e'en at Squire's fine wedding
          Such dainties did I see!

          But none heed country elves;
          These folk, with lace daub'd over,
          Love only dear themselves.
          Thus whilst, 'mid joys abounding,
          As grasshoppers they're gay;

          The Lady of the May.

      its variegated lamps give place to some solitary gas-burner, to light the

      once celebrated vocalists be drowned in the dismal ditty of some
      ballad-singing weaver, and the screeching responses of his itinerant

     ** Certain utilitarians affect to ridicule this ancient
     civic festival, on the score of its parade, right-royally
     ridiculous! and gross gluttony&mdash;as if the corporation of
     London were the only gourmands who had offered sacrifices to
     Apicius, and died martyrs to good living! We have been at
     some pains to peep into the dining-parlours of the ancients,
     and from innumerable examples of gastronomy have selected
     the following, which prove that the epicures of the olden
     time yielded not in taste and voracity to their brethren of
     the new:&mdash;

     The emperor Septimus Severus died of eating and drinking too
     much. Valentinianus went off in a surfeit. Lucullus being
     asked one day by his attendant, what company he had invited
     to his feast, seeing so many dainties prepared, answered,
     &ldquo;Lucullus shall dine with Lucullus?&rdquo; Vitellius Spinter was
     so much given to gluttony, that at one supper he was served
     with two thousand several kinds of fishes, and with seven
     thousand flying fowl. Maximilian devoured, in one day, forty
     pounds of solid meat, which he washed down with a hogshead
     of wine. The emperor Geta continued his festival for three
     days, and his dainties were introduced in alphabetical
     order. Philoxenes wished he had a neck like a crane, that
     the delicious morsels might be long in going down. Lucullus,
     at a costly feast he gave to certain ambassadors of Asia,
     among other trifles, took to his own cheek a griph (query
     Griffin'!) boiled, and a fat goose in paste. Hercules and
     Lepreas had a friendly contest, which could, in quickest
     time, eat up a whole ox; Hercules won, and then challenged
     his adversary to a drinking bout, and again beat him hollow.

     If the Stoic held that the goal of life is death, and that
     we live but to learn to die&mdash;if the Pythagorean believed in
     the transmigration of souls, and scrupled to shoot a
     woodcock lest he should dispossess the spirit of his
     grandam&mdash;how much more rational was the doctrine of the
     Epicurean, (after such a goodly catalogue of gormandizers!)
     that there was no judgement to come.

      Who has not heard of Guildhall on Lord Mayor's Day, ** and the Easter Ball
      at the Mansion-House? But we profane not the penetralia where even
      Common-Councilmen fear to tread! The City Marshals, and men in armour (<i>Héros
      malgré eux!</i>); the pensive-looking state-coachmen, in all the
      plumpness, pomp, and verdure of prime feeding, wig, and bouquet; the
      postilion, &ldquo;a noticeable man,&rdquo; with velvet cap and jockey boots; the
      high-bred and high-fed aristocracy of the Poultry and Cheapside, and their
      Banquet, which might tempt Diogenes to blow himself up to such a pitch of
      obesity, that, instead of living in a tub, a tub might be said to live in
      him, are subjects too lofty for plebeian handling. Cæsar was told to
      beware of the Ides of March; and are not November fogs equally ominous to
      the London citizen? If, then, by some culinary magic, he can be induced to
      cram his throat rather than to cut it,&mdash;to feast himself instead of
      the worms,&mdash;to prefer a minuet in the Council Chamber to the Dance
      Macabre in the shades below,&mdash;the gorgeous anniversaries of Gog and
      Magog have not been celebrated in vain. *

     conclude his life only in this certainty, that there is no
     subject upon earth received into the place of his government
     with the like state and magnificence as is the Lord Maior of
     the Citty of London.&rdquo; This was said by the author of the
     &ldquo;Triumphs of Truth&rdquo; in 1613. The following list of City
     Poets will show that the office was not an unimportant one
     in the olden time: George Peele; Anthony Munday; Thomas
     Dekker; Thomas Middleton; John Squire; John Webster; Thomas
     Heywood; John Taylor (the Water-Poet, one of Ben Jonson's
     adopted poetical sons, and a rare slang fellow); Edward G ay
     ton, and T. B. (of the latter nothing is known), both
     Commonwealth bards; John Tatham; Thomas Jordan; Matthew
     Taubman, and Elkanah Settle, the last of the poetical
     parsons who wedded Lord Mayors and Aldermen to immortal
     verse. One of the most splendid of these anniversary
     pageants was &ldquo;London's Triumph; or, the Solemn and
     Magnificent reception of that Honourable Gentleman, Robert
     Titeliburn, Lord Maior, after his return from taking his
     oath at Westminster, the morrow after Simon and Jude day,
     being October 29, 1656. With the Speeches spoken at Foster-
     lane-end and Soper-lane-end.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; (says
     the City Poet T. B.) &ldquo;the loving members of the honourable
     societie exercising arms in Cripplegate Ground being drawn
     up together, march'd in a military order to the house of my
     Lord Maior, where they attended on him, and from thence
     march'd before him to the Three Crane Wharfe, where part of
     them under the red colours embarqued themselves in three
     severall barges; and another part took water at Stone
     Staires, being under green colours, as enemies to the other;
     and thence wafting to the other side of the water, there
     began an encounter between each party, which continued all
     the way to Westminster; a third body, consisting of pikes
     and musquets, march'd to Bainard's Castle, and there from
     the battlements of the castle gave thundering echoes to the
     vollies of those that pass'd along the streame. Part before
     and part behind went the severall barges, with drums
     beating, and trumpets sounding, and varietie of other musiek
     to take the eare, while the flags and silver pendents made a
     pleasant sight delectable to the beholders.

     &ldquo;After these came severall gentlemen-ushers adorn'd with
     gold eliaines; behind them certaine rich batelielours,
     wearing gownes furr'd with foynes, and upon them sattin
     hoods; and lastly after them, followed the Worshipfull
     Company of Skinners itself, whereof the Lord Maior is a
     member. Next these, the city officers passing on before,
     rode the Lord Maior with the Sword, Mace, and Cap of
     Maintenance before him, being attended by the Recorder, and
     all the aldermen in scarlet gowns on horseback. (Aldermen on
     horseback!!) Thus attended, he rode from Bainard's Castle
     into

     Cheapside, the Companies standing on both sides of the way
     as far as the upper end of the Old Jury, ready to receive
     him. When he was come right against the old Change, a
     pageant seem'd to meet him. On the pageant stood two
     leopards bestrid by two Moors, attir'd in the habit of their
     country; at the foure corners sate foure virgins arraid in
     cloth of silver, with their haire dishriveld, and coronets
     on their heads. This seem'd to be the embleme of a city
     pensive and forlorn, for want of a zealous governor: the
     Moors and leopards, like evill customs tyrannizing over the
     weak virginitie of undefended virtue; which made an aged
     man, who sate at the fore part of the pageant, mantled in a
     black garment, with a dejected countenance, seem to bewaile
     the condition of his native city; but thus he remaind not
     long: for at the approach of the Lord Maior, as if now he
     had espy'd the safety of his country, he threw off his
     mourning weeds, and with the following speech made known the
     joy he had for the election of so happy and just a
     magistrate.

     &ldquo;The speech being spoken, the first pageant past on before
     the Lord Maior as far as Mercers' Chappel; a gyant being
     twelve foot in height going before the pageant for the
     delight of the people. Over against Soper-lane End stood
     another pageant also; upon this were plac'd severall sorts
     of beasts, as lyons, tygers, bears, leopards, foxes, apes,
     monkeys, in a great wildernesse; at the forepart whereof
     sate Pan with a pipe in his hand; in the middle was a
     canopie, at the portal whereof sate Orpheus in an antique
     attire, playing on his harp, while all the beasts seem'd to
     dance at the sound of his melody. Under the canopie sate
     four satyrs playing on pipes. The embleme of this pageant
     seem'd proper to the Company out of which the Lord Maior was
     elected; putting the spectators in mind how much they ought
     to esteem such a calling, as clad the Judges in their
     garments of honour, and Princes in their robes of majestic,
     and makes the wealthy ladies covet winter, to appear clad in
     their sable funs. A second signification of this emblem may
     be this,&mdash;that as Orpheus tam'd the wild beasts by the
     alluring sound of his melody, so doth a just and upright
     governor tame and govern the wild affections of men, by good
     and wholesome lawes, causing a general joy and peace in the
     place where he commands. Which made Orpheus, being well
     experienced in this truth, to address himself to the Lord
     Maior in these following lines.

     &ldquo;The speech being ended, the Lord Maior rode forward to his
     house in Silver Street, the military bands still going
     before him. When he was in this house, they saluted him with
     two volleys of shot, and so marching again to their ground
     in Cripple-gate Churchyard, they lodg'd their colours; and
     as they began, so concluded this dayes triumph.&rdquo;

     When the barges wherein the soldiers were, came right
     against Whitehall, they saluted the Lord Protector and his
     Council with several rounds of musketry, which the Lord
     Protector answered with &ldquo;signal testimonies of grace and
     cour-tesie.&rdquo; And returning to Whitehall, after the Lord
     Mayor had taken the oath of office before the Barons of the
     Exchequer, they saluted the Lord Protector with &ldquo;another
     volley&rdquo; The City of London had been actively instrumental in
     the deposition and death of King Charles the First, and
     Cromwell could not do less than acknowledge, with some show
     of respect, the blank cartridges of his old friends. The
     furr'd gowns and gold chains, however, made the amende
     honorable, when they &ldquo;jumped Jim Crow,&rdquo; and helped to
     restore King Charles the Second.

      But Easter-Monday was not made only for the city's dancing dignitaries. It

     * June 9, 1786. On Whit-Tuesday was celebrated at Hendon in
     Middlesex, a burlesque imitation of the Olympic Games.

     One prize was a gold-laced hat, to be grinned for by six
     candidates, who were placed on a platform, with horses'
     collars to exhibit through. Over their heads was printed in
     capitals,

          Detur Tetriori; or
          The ugliest grinner
          Shall be the winner.

     Each party grinned five minutes solus, and then all united
     in a grand chorus of distortion. This prize was carried by a
     porter to a vinegar merchant, though he was accused by his
     competitors of foul play, for rinsing his mouth with
     verjuice. The whole was concluded by a hog, with his tail
     shaved and soaped, being let loose among nine peasants; any
     one of which that could seize him by the queue, and throw
     him across his shoulders, was to have him for a reward. This
     occasioned much sport: the animal, after running some miles,
     so tired his hunters that they gave up the chase in despair.
     A prodigious concourse of people attended, among whom were
     the Tripoline Ambassador, and several other persons of
     distinction.

      delight to contemplate the mirthful mourners in their endless variety of

     * On the Easter-Monday of 1840, the Regent's Park, Primrose
     Hill, and the adjoining fields, presented one merry mass of
     animated beings. At Chalk Farm there was a regular fair,&mdash;
     with swings, roundabouts, ups-and-downs, gingerbread-stalls,
     theatres, donkey-races, penny chaises, and puppet-shows,
     representing the Islington murder, the Queen's marriage, the
     arrival of Prince Albert, and the departure of the Chartist
     rioters! Hampstead Heath, and the surrounding villages,
     turned out their studs of Jerusalem ponies. Copenhagen
     House, Hornsey Wood House and the White Conduit, echoed with
     jollity; the holiday-makers amusing themselves with cricket,
     fives, and archery. How sweetly has honest, merry Harry
     Carey described the origin of &ldquo;Sally in our Alley&rdquo; which
     touelied the heart of Addison with tender emotion, and
     called forth his warmest praise. &ldquo;A shoemaker's 'prentice,
     making holiday with his sweetheart, treated her with a sight
     of Bedlam, the puppet-shows, the flying-chairs, and all the
     elegancies of Moorfields, from whence proceeding to the
     Farthing Pye-house, he gave her a collation of buns,
     cheese-cakes, gammon of bacon, stuffed beef, and bottled
     ale; through all which scenes the author dodged them.
     Charmed with the simplicity of their courtship, he drew from
     what he had witnessed this little sketch of Nature.&rdquo;

      What an animated scene! Hark to the loud laugh of some youngsters that
      have had their roll and tumble. Yonder is a wedding party from the
      neighbouring village. See the jolly tar with his true blue jacket and
      trousers, checked shirt, radiant with a gilt brooch as big as a crown
      piece, yellow straw-hat, striped stockings, and pumps; and his pretty
      bride, with her rosy cheeks and white favours. How light are their heels
      and hearts! And the blythesome couples that follow in their train&mdash;noviciates

      &ldquo;2. The Noble <i>Vultur Cock</i>, brought from <i>Archangell</i>, having
      the finest talions of any bird that seeks his prey; the fore part of his
      head is covered with hair, the second part resembles the wool of a Black;
      below that is a white ring, having a Ruff, that he cloaks his head with at
      night.

      &ldquo;3. An <i>Eagle of the Sun</i>, that takes the loftiest flight of any bird
      that flies. There is no bird but this that can fly to the face of the Sun

      thousands of spots, and not two of a likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;6 &amp; 7. The two fierce and surprising <i>Hyaenas</i>, Male and female,
      from the River <i>Gambia</i>. These Creatures imitate the human voice, and
      so decoy the Negroes out of their huts and plantations to devour them.
      They have a mane like a horse, and two joints in their hinder leg more
      than any other creature. It is remarkable that all other beasts are to be
      tamed, but Hyaenas they are not.

      The grand focus of attraction was in the immediate vicinity of the &ldquo;<i>Kentish
      Drovers</i>.&rdquo; This-once merry hostelrie was a favourite suburban retreat
      of Dicky Suett. Cherub Dicky! who when (to use his own peculiar phrase)
      his &ldquo;copper required cooling,&rdquo; mounted the steady, old-fashioned, three
      mile an hour Peckham stage, and journeyed hither to allay his thirst, and
      qualify his alcohol with a refreshing draught of Derbyshire ale. The
      landlord (who was quite a character) and he were old cronies; and, in the
      snug little parlour behind the bar, of which Dicky had the entrée, their
      hob-and-nobbings struck out sparks of humour that, had they exhaled before
      the lamps, would have set the theatre in a roar. Suett was a great
      frequenter of fairs. He stood treat to the conjurors, feasted the tragedy
      kings and queens, and many a mountebank did he make muzzy. Once in a
      frolic he changed clothes with a Jack Pudding, and played <i>Barker</i>
      and <i>Mr. Merriman</i> to a precocious giantess; when he threw her lord
      and master into such an ecstacy of mirth, that the fellow vowed
      hysterically that it was either the <i>devil</i>, or (for his fame had
      travelled before him) <i>Dicky Suett</i>. He was a piscator, *

     * All sports that inflict pain on any living thing, without
     attaining some useful end, are wanton and cowardly. Wild
     boars, wolves, foxes, &amp;c. may be hunted to extermination,
     for they are public robbers; but to hunt the noble deer, for
     the cruel pleasure of hunting him, is base.

     With all our love of honest Izaak Walton, we feel a
     shuddering when the &ldquo;sentimental old savage&rdquo; gives his
     minute instructions to the tyro in angling how most
     skilfully to transfix the writhing worm, (as though you
     &ldquo;loved him!&rdquo;) and torture a poor fish. Piscator is a
     cowardly rogue to sit upon a fair bank, the sun shining
     above, and the pure stream rippling beneath, with his
     instruments of death, playing pang against pang, and life
     against life, for his contemplative recreation. What would
     he say to a hook through his own gullet? Would it mitigate
     his dying agonies to hear his dirge (even the milkmaid's
     song!) chanted in harmonious concert with a brother of the
     angle, who had played the like sinister trick on his
     companion in the waters?

      and would make a huge parade of his rod, line, and green-painted tin-can,
      sallying forth on a fine morning with malice prepense against the gudgeons
      and perch: but Dicky was a merciful angler: he was the gudgeon, for the
      too cunning fishes, spying his comical figure, stole his bait, and he
      hooked nothing but tin pots and old shoes. Here he sat in his accustomed
      chair and corner, dreaming of future quarterns, and dealing out odd
      sayings that would make the man in the moon hold his sides, and convulse
      the whole planet with laughter. His hypocrene was the cream of the valley;
      *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Suett had at one time a landlady who exhibited an
     inordinate love for that vulgar fluid ycleped geneva; a
     beverage which Dicky himself by no means held in abhorrence.
     She would order her servant to procure supplies after the
     following fashion:&mdash;&ldquo;Betty, go and get a quartern loaf and
     half a quartern of gin.&rdquo; Off bolted Betty,&mdash;she was speedily
     recalled: &ldquo;Betty, make it half a quartern loaf and a
     quartern of gin.&rdquo; But Betty had never got fairly across the
     threshold, ere the voice was again heard:&mdash;&ldquo;Betty, on second
     thoughts, you may as well make it all gin!&rdquo;

      he dug his grave with his bottle, and gave up the ghost amidst a troop of
      spirits. Peace to his <i>manes!</i> Cold is the cheerful hearth, where he
      familiarly stirred the embers and silent the walls that echoed to &ldquo;<i>Old
      Wigs!</i>&rdquo; chanted by <i>Jeffery Dunstan</i> when he danced hop-scotch on
      a table spread out with tumblers and tobacco-pipes! Hushed is the voice of
      song. At this moment, as if to give our last assertion what Touchstone
      calls &ldquo;the lie direct,&rdquo; some Corydon from Petty France, the Apollo of a
      select singing party in the first floor front room, thus musically
      apostrophised his Blouzellinda of Bloomsbury.

      &ldquo;This is to give notice to all gentlemen, ladies and others, that there is
      to be seen from eight in the morning till nine at night, at the end of the
      great booth on <i>Blackheath</i>, a west of England woman 38 years of age
      <i>alive</i>, with <i>two heads</i>, one above the other; having no hands,
      fingers, nor toes; yet can she dress and undress, knit, sew, read, sing,&rdquo;
       <i>Query&mdash;a duet with her two mouths?</i> &ldquo;She has had the honour to
      be seen by Sir Hans Sloane, and several of the Royal Society. * &ldquo;N.B.
      Gentlemen and ladies may see her at their own houses, if they please.

     * That the caricaturist has been out-caricatured by Nature
     no one will deny. Wilkes was so abominably ugly that he said
     it always took him half an hour to talk away his face; and
     Mirabeau, speaking of his own countenance, said, &ldquo;Fancy a
     tiger marked with the small-pox!&rdquo; We have seen an Adonis
     contemplate one of Cruikshank's whimsical figures, of which
     his particular shanks were the bow-ideal, and rail at the
     artist for libelling Dame Nature! How ill-favoured were Lord
     Lovat, Magliabeeehi, Searron, and the wall-eyed, botde-nosed
     Buekhorse the Bruiser! how deformed and frightful Sir Harry
     Dimsdale and Sir Jeffrey Dunstan! What would have been said
     of the painter of imaginary Siamese twins? Yet we have &ldquo;The
     true Description of two Monstrous Children, born in the
     parish of Swanburne in Buekinghamshyre, the 4th of Aprill,
     Anno Domini 1566; the two Children having both their belies
     fast joyned together, and imbracing one another with their
     armes: which Children were both alyve by the space of half
     an hower, and wer baptised, and named the one John, and the
     other Joan.&rdquo;&mdash;A similar wonder was exhibited in Queen Anne's
     reign, viz. &ldquo;Two monstrous girls born in the Kingdom of
     Hungary,&rdquo; which were to be seen &ldquo;from 8 o'clock in the
     morning till 8 at night, up one pair of stairs, at Mr.
     William Sutteliffe's, a Drugster's Shop, at the sign of the
     Golden Anchor, in the Strand, near Charing-Cross.&rdquo; The
     Siamese twins of our own time are fresh in every one's
     memory. Shakspere throws out a pleasant sarcasm at the
     characteristic curiosity of the English nation. Trinculo,
     upon first beholding Caliban, exclaims,&mdash;&ldquo;A strange fish!
     were I in England now (as I once was), and had but this fish
     painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of
     silver: there would this monster make a man: when they will
     not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out
     ten to see a dead Indian&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This great wonder never was shown in England before this, the 13th day of
      March, 1741. &ldquo;Vivat Rex.&rdquo; Peckham * and Blackheath Fairs are abolished;&mdash;&mdash;

     * Peckham Fair, August 1787.&mdash;Of the four-footed race were
     bears, monkeys, dancing-dogs, a learned pig, &amp;c. Mr.
     Flockton in his theatrical booth opposite the Kentish
     Drovers, exhibited the Italian fantocini; the farce of the
     Conjuror; and his &ldquo;inimitable musical-clock.&rdquo; Mr. Lane,
     &ldquo;first performer to the King,&rdquo; played off his &ldquo;snip-snap,
     rip-rap, crick-crack, and thunder tricks, that the grown
     babies stared like worried cats.&rdquo; This extraordinary genius
     &ldquo;will drive about forty twelve-penny nails into any
     gentleman's breech, place him in a loadstone chair, and draw
     them out without the least pain! He is, in short, the most
     wonderful of all wonderful creatures the world ever wondered
     at.&rdquo;

     Sir Jeffrey Dunstan sported his handsome figure within his
     booth; outside of which was displayed a likeness of the
     elegant original in his pink satin smalls. His dress,
     address, and oratory, fascinated the audience; in fact,
     &ldquo;Jeffy was quite tonish!&rdquo;

     In opposition to the &ldquo;Monstrous Craws&rdquo; at the Royal Grove,
     were shown in a barn &ldquo;four wonderful human creatures,
     brought three thousand miles beyond China, from the
     Kickashaw Mackabee country, viz.

     &ldquo;A man with a chin eleven inches Ions:.

     &ldquo;Another with as many M'ens and warts on his face as knots
     on an old thornback.

     &ldquo;A third with two large teeth five inches long, strutting
     beyond his upper lip, as if his father had been a man-tiger!

     &ldquo;And the fourth with a noble large fiery head, that looked
     like the red-hot urn on the top of the monument!&rdquo;

     &ldquo;These most wonderful wild-born human beings (the Monstrous
     Craws), two females and a male, are of very small stature,
     being little more than four feet high; each with a monstrous
     craw under his throat. Their country, language, &amp;c. are as
     yet unknown to mankind. It is supposed they started in some
     canoe from their native place (a remote quarter in South
     America), and being wrecked were picked up by a Spanish
     vessel. At that period they were each of a dark-olive
     complexion, but which has astonishingly, by degrees, changed
     to the colour of that of Europeans. They are tractable and
     respectful towards strangers, and of lively and merry
     disposition among themselves; singing and daneing in the
     most extraordinary way, at the will and pleasure of the
     company.&rdquo;

      and those of Camberwell * and Wandsworth ** are

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A petty session (how very petty!) was held at Union Hall
     on the 4th July, 1823, in order to put down Camberwell Fair,
     which is as old as Domesday Book. Shakspere has truly
     described these ill-conditioned, peddling, meddling
     Dogberrys &ldquo;You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing
     a cause between an orange-wife and a fosset-seller; and then
     rejourn the controversy of three-pence to a second day of
     audience. When you speak best to the purpose, it is not
     worth the wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve
     not so honourable a grave, as to stuff a botcher's cushion,
     or to be entombed in an ass's pack-saddle.&rdquo;

     ** Wandsworth Fair exhibited sixty years ago Mount Vesuvius,
     or the burning mountain by moonlight, rope, and hornpipe-
     dancing; a forest, with the humours of lion-catching;
     tumbling by the young Polander from Sadler's Wells; several
     diverting comic songs; a humorous dialogue between Mr.
     Swatehall and his wife; sparring matches; the Siege of
     Belgrade, &amp;c. all for three-penee!

     On Whit-Monday, 1840, Messrs. Nelson and Lee sent down a
     theatrical caravan to Wandsworth Fair, and were moderately
     remunerated. But the &ldquo;Grand Victoria Booth&rdquo; was the rallying
     point of attraction. Its refectory was worthy of the
     ubiquitous Mr. Epps&mdash;of ham, beef, tongue, polony, portable
     soup, and sheep's trotter memory!

     Cold beef and ham, hot ribs of lamb, mock-turtle soup that's
     portable,

     Did blow, with stout, their jackets out, and made the folks
     comfortable!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In the year 1820, the keeper of a menagerie at Edmonton
     Fair walked into the den of a lioness, and nursed her cubs.
     He then paid his respects to the husband and father, a
     magnificent Barbary Lion. After the usual complimentary
     greetings between them, the man somewhat roughly thrust open
     the monster's jaws, and put his head into its mouth, giving
     at the same time a shout that made it tremble. This he did
     with impunity. But in less than two months afterwards, when
     repeating the same exhibition at a fair in the provinces, he
     eried, like the starling, &ldquo;I can't get out!&mdash;I can't get
     out!&rdquo; demanding at the same time if the lion wagged its
     tail? The lion, thinking the joke had been played quite
     often enough, did wag its tail, and roared &ldquo;Heads!&rdquo; The
     keeper fell a victim to his temerity.

     ** &ldquo;July 2,1744.&mdash;This is to give notice that Highgate Fair
     will be kept on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday next, in a
     pleasant shady walk in the middle of the town.

     &ldquo;On Wednesday a pig will be turned loose, and he that takes
     it up by the tail and throws it over his head, shall have
     it. To pay two-pence entrance, and no less than twelve to
     enter.

     &ldquo;On Thursday a match will be run by two men, a hundred yards
     in two sacks, for a large sum. And, to encourage the sport,
     the landlord of the Mitre will give a pair of gloves, to be
     run for by six men, the winner to have them.

     &ldquo;And on Friday a hat, value ten shillings, will be run for
     by men twelve times round the Green; to pay one shilling
     entrance: no less than four to start; as many as will may
     enter, and the second man to have all the money above four.&rdquo;

      West-end (Hampstead * ), Fairs, with their swings, roundabouts, spiced

     * &ldquo;The Hampstead Fair Ramble; or, The World going quite Mad.
     To the tune of 'Brother Soldier dost hear of the News,'
     London: Printed for J. Bland, near Holbourn, 1708.&rdquo; A
     curious broadside.

     ** Moorfields during the holiday seasons was an epitome of
     Bartlemy Fair. Its booths and scaffolds had flags flying on
     the top. A stage near the Windmill Tavern, opposite Old
     Beth-lem, was famous for its grinning-matches. Moorfields
     had one novel peculiarity, viz. that whilst the Merry Andrew
     was practising his buffooneries and legerdemain tricks in
     one quarter, the itinerant Methodist preacher was holding
     forth in another. Foote makes his ranting parson exclaim,

     &ldquo;Near the mad mansions of Moorfields I 'll bawl,

     Come fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, all,

     Shut up your shops and listen to my call!&rdquo;

     The Act 12 of Queen Anne aimed at the suppression of the
     Moorfields' merriments. The showmen asked Justice Fuller to
     license them in April, 1717, but in vain. Fuller had a
     battle-royal with Messrs. Saunders and Margaret, two
     Middlesex justices, who sided with the conjurors, and
     forbade the execution of his warrant. Justice Fuller,
     however, having declared war against Moorfields'
     mountebanking, was inexorable, and committed the insurgents
     to the house of correction; from whence, after three hours'
     durance vile, they were released by three other magistrates.

     Kennington Common was also a favourite spot for this odd
     variety of sports. It was here that Mr. Mawworm encountered
     the brick-bats of his congregation, and had his &ldquo;pious tail&rdquo;
      illuminated with the squibs and crackers of the unre-
     generate.

     This fair commenced in the New River pipe-fields, and
     continued in a direct line as far as the top of Elm Street,
     where it terminated. The equestrians always made a point of
     galloping their donkeys furiously past the house of
     correction!

     * &ldquo;April 9, 1748.&mdash;At the Amphitheatrical Booth at Tottenham
     Court, on Monday next (being Easter Monday), Mr. French,
     designing to please all, in making his Country Wake complete
     by doubling the prizes given to be played for, as well as
     the sports, has engaged some of the best gamesters, Country
     against London, to make sides. For Cudgelling, a laced hat,
     value one pound five shillings, or one guinea in gold; for
     Wrestling, one guinea; Money for Boxing, besides Stage-

     Mr. French advertises, May 12, 1748, at his booth at

     the length of the stage backwards and forwards for a prize,&mdash;
     a prize for wrestling and dancing to the pipe and tabor,&mdash;

     the Welsh Fair, will be the usual entertainment of Roast
     Pork, with the fam'd soft-flavor'd Spaw Ale, and every other
     liquor of the neatest and best kinds, agreeable
     entertainments, and inviting usage from the Publick's most
     obedient servant, George Dowdell.&rdquo;

     In the year 1795 a Dutch Fair was held at Frogmore, when a
     grand fête was given by King George the Third, in
     celebration of his Queen's birth-day, and the recent arrival
     of the Princess of Wales. A number of dancers were dressed
     as haymakers; Mr. Byrne and his company danced the Morris-
     dance; and Savoyards, in character, assisted at the
     merriments. Feats of horsemanship were exhibited by
     professors from the Circus; and booths erected for good
     eating and drinking, and the sale of toys, work-bags,
     pocket-books, and fancy articles. Munden, Rock, and Incledon
     diverted the company with their mirth and music; and Majesty
     participated in the general joy. The Royal Dutch Fair lasted
     two days, and was under the tasteful direction of the
     Princess Elizabeth.

      May Fair (which began on May-day), during the early part of the last
      century, was much patronised by the nobility and gentry. It had
      nevertheless its Ducking Pond for the ruder class of holiday makers. **
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * By an act passed 3rd of 2nd Victoria (not Victoria for the
     Fair!) it was rendered unlawful to hold Fairlop Fair beyond
     the first Friday (&ldquo;Friday's a dry day!&rdquo;) in July. This was
     the handy work of the Barking Magistrates.

     &ldquo;And when I walk abroad let no dog bark!&rdquo;

     ** &ldquo;June 25, 1748.&mdash;At May Fair Ducking Pond, on Monday
     next, the 27th inst., Mr. Hooton's Dog Nero (ten years old,
     with hardly a tooth in his head to hold a duck, but well
     known for his goodness to all that have seen him hunt) hunts
     six ducks for a guinea, against the bitch called the Flying
     Spaniel, from the Ducking Pond on the other side of the
     water, who has beat all she has hunted against, excepting
     Mr. Hooton's Good-Blood. To begin at two o'clock.

     &ldquo;Mr. Hooton begs his customers won't take it amiss to pay
     Twopence admittance at the gate, and take a ticket, which
     will be allowed as Cash in their reckoning. No person
     admitted without a tickct, that such as are not liked may be
     kept out.

     &ldquo;Note. Right Lincoln Ale.&rdquo;

     Apropos of other mirthful rendezvous.

     &ldquo;A new Ducking Pond to be opened on Monday next at
     Lirneiouse Cause, being the 11th August, where four dogs
     are to play for Four Pounds, and a lamb to be roasted whole,
     to be given away to all gentlemen sportsmen. To begin at Ten
     o'clock in the forenoon.&rdquo;&mdash;Postman, 7th August 1707.

     &ldquo;Erith Diversion, 24th May 1790.&mdash;This is to acquaint the
     publick, that on Whit-Monday, and during the holidays, the
     undermentioned diversions will take place. First, a new Hat
     to be run for by men; a fine Ham to be played for at Trap-
     ball; a pair of new Pumps to be jumped for in a sack; a
     large Plumb-pudding to be sung for; a Guinea to be cudgelled
     for,&mdash;with smoking, grinning through a collar, with many
     other diversions too tedious to mention.

     &ldquo;N.B. A Ball in the evening as usual.&rdquo;

     But what are the hopes of man! A press-gang (this is the
     freedom of the press with a vengeance! this the boasted
     monarchy of the middle classes!) interrupted and put an end
     to these water-side sports.

     Kent has long been renowned for strong muscles and strong
     stomachs!

     &ldquo;Bromley in Kent, July 14, 1726.&mdash;A strange eating worthy is
     to perform a Tryal of Skill on St. James's Day, which is
     the day of our Fair for a wager of Five Guineas,&mdash;viz.: he
     is to eat four pounds of bacon, a bushel of French beans,
     with two pounds of butter, a quartern loaf, and to drink a
     gallon of strong beer.&rdquo;

     The old proverb of &ldquo;buttering bacon&rdquo; here receives
     farinaceous illustration!

      &ldquo;In a fore one-pair room, on the west side of Sun-court,&rdquo; a Frenchman
      exhibited, during the time of May Fair, the &ldquo;astonishing strength of the
      'Strong Woman,' * his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She first let down her hair, of a length descending to her knees, which
      she twisted round the projecting part of a blacksmith's anvil, and then
      lifted the ponderous weight from the floor. She also put her bare feet on
      a red-hot salamander, without receiving the least injury.&rdquo; May Fair is now
      become the site of aristocratical dwellings, where a strong purse is
      required to procure a standing. At Horn Fair, a party of humorists of both
      sexes, counted in all the variety of Bull-Feather fashion, after
      perambulating round Cuckold Point, startled the little quiet village of
      Charlton on St. Luke's day, shouting their emulation, and blowing
      voluntaries on rams' horns, in honour of their patron saint. Ned Ward
      gives a curious picture of this odd ceremony,&mdash;and the press of <i>Stonecutter
      Street</i> (the worthy successor of <i>Aldermary Churchyard</i>) has
      consigned it to immortality in two Broadsides ** inspired by the Helicon
      of the Fleet,

     * This was probably Mrs. Alchorne, &ldquo;who had exhibited as the
     Strong Woman&rdquo; and died in Drury Lane in 1817, at a very
     advanced age. Madame also performed at Bartholomew Fair in
     1752.

      ranked next to St. Bartholomew, and comprehended all the attractions for
      which its rival on the other side of the water was so famous. On the 13th
      day of September 1660, John Evelyn visited it. &ldquo;I saw,&rdquo; said this
      entertaining sight-seer, &ldquo;in Southwark, at St. Margaret's Faire, monkies
      and apes daunce, and do other feates of activity on ye high rope: they
      were gallantly clad <i>à la mode</i>, went upright, saluted the company,
      bowing and pulling off their hats; they saluted one another with as good a
      grace as if instructed by a dauncing-master; they turned heels over head
      with a basket having eggs in it, without breaking any; also with lighted
      candles in their hands, and on their heads, without extinguishing them,
      and with vessels of water, without spilling a drop. I also saw an Italian
      wench daunce and performe all the tricks of ye tight rope to admiration.
      All the Court went to see her. Likewise here was a man who tooke up a
      piece of iron cannon, of about 400 lbs weight, with the haire of his head
      onely.&rdquo; September 15, 1698, the curious old narrator paid it another
      visit. &ldquo;The dreadful earthquake in Jamaica this summer&rdquo; (says he) &ldquo;was
      prophanely and ludicrously represented in a puppet-play, or some such lewd
      pastime in the fair of Southwark, wch caused the Queane to put downe that
      idle and vicious mock shew.&rdquo; The fair, however, revived, and outlived her
      Majesty many merry years. How slept the authorities some seasons ago, when
      Messrs. Mathews and Yates dramatised an &ldquo;Earthquake&rdquo; at the Adelphi!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bowling Green in Southwark was the high 'Change of the Fair. Mr.
      Fawkes, the conjuror, exhibited at his booth, over against the Crown
      Tavern, near St. George's Church. Dramatic representations, music and
      dancing, the humours of Punch and Harlequin, a glass of &ldquo;good wine, and
      other liquors,&rdquo; were to be had at the several booths held at the &ldquo;Golden
      Horse-shoe,&rdquo; * the &ldquo;Half-Moon Inn,&rdquo; ** and other well-known houses of
      entertainment. Thither resorted Lee and Harper to delight the denizens of
      Kent Street, Guy's Hospital, and St. Thomas's, with Guy of Warwick, Robin
      Hood, the comical adventures of Little John and the Pindar's wife, and the
      Fall of Phaëton! In July 1753, the Tennis Court and booths that were on
      the Bowling Green, with some other buildings where the fair used to be
      held, were pulled down; and shortly after, that pleasant Bowling Green was
      converted into a potato and cabbage market!

     * &ldquo;Joseph Parnes's Musiek Rooms, at the sign of the Whelp
     and Bacon, during Southwark Fair, are at the Golden Horse-
     Shoe, next to the King's Bench, where you may be entertained
     with a variety of musick and dancing after the Scotch,
     Italian, and English ways. A Girl dances with sharp swords,
     the like not in England.&rdquo;&mdash;Temp. W. 3.

     &ldquo;There is to be seen at Mr. Hocknes, at the Maremaid, near
     the King's Bench, in Southwark, during the time of the Fair,
     A Changeling Child, being A Living Skeleton, Taken by a
     Venetian Galley from a Turkish Vessel in the Archipelago.
     This was a fairy child, supposed to be born of Hungarian
     parents, but changed in the nursery; aged 9 years and more,
     not exceeding a foot and a half high. The legs and arms so
     very small, that they scarcely exceed the bigness of a man's
     thumb; and the face no bigger than the palm of one's hand.
     She is likewise a mere anatomy.&rdquo;&mdash;Temp. W. 3.

     ** &ldquo;Sept. 12, 1729.&mdash;At Reynold's Great Theatrical Booth, in
     the Half-Moon Inn, near the Bowling-Green, Southwark, during
     the Fair will be presented the Beggar's Wedding,&mdash;Southwark
     Fair, or the Sheep-Shearing,&mdash;an opera called Flora,&mdash;and
     The Humours of Harlequin.&rdquo;

      Southwark, or Lady Fair, has long since been suppressed. Thanks, however,
      to the &ldquo;great painter of mankind,&rdquo; that we can hold it as often as we
      please in our own breakfast-parlours and drawing-rooms! The works of
      Hogarth are medicines for melancholy. If the mood be of Jacques's quality,
      &ldquo;a most humorous sadness,&rdquo; it will revel in the master's whim; if of a
      deeper tinge, there is the dark side of the picture for mournful
      reflection. Though an unsparing satirist, probing vice and folly to the
      quick, he has compassion for human frailty and sorrow. He is no vulgar
      caricaturist, making merry with personal deformity; he paints wickedness
      in its true colours, and if the semblance be hideous, the original, not
      the copy, is to blame. His scenes are faithful transcripts of life, high
      and low. He conducts us into the splendid saloons of fashion;&mdash;we
      pass with him into the direst cells of want and misery. He reads a lesson
      to idleness, extravagance, and debauchery, such as never was read before.
      He is equally master of the pathetic and the ludicrous. He exhibits the
      terrible passions, and their consequences, with almost superhuman power.
      Every stroke of his pencil points a moral; every object, however
      insignificant, has its meaning. His detail is marvellous, and bespeaks a
      mind pregnant with illustration, an eye that nothing could escape.
      Bysshe's Art of Poetry, the well-chalked tally, the map of the gold mines,
      and the starved cur making off with the day's lean provision, are in
      perfect keeping with the distressed poet's ragged finery, his half-mended
      breeches, and all the exquisite minutiae of his garret. His very wig, most
      picturesquely awry, is a happy symbol of poetical and pecuniary
      perplexity. Of the same marking character are the cow's horns, rising just
      above the little citizen's head, in the print of &ldquo;<i>Evening</i>,&rdquo; telling
      a sly tale; while the <i>dramatis personae</i> of the Strollers' Barn, the
      flags, paint-pots, pageants, clouds, waves, puppets, dark-lanterns,
      thunder, lightning, daggers, periwigs, crowns, sceptres, salt-boxes,
      ghosts, devils, and tragedy queens exhibit such an unique miscellany of
      wonders, that none but an Hogarth ever thought of bringing together. Turn,
      by way of contrast, to &ldquo;Gin Lane,&rdquo; and its frightful accompaniments!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth went quite as much to see Southwark Fair and its fun (for which he
      had a high relish) as to transfer them to his canvass. 'Tis a holiday with
      the mountebanks, and he has caught them in all their grimacerie and glory.
      A troop of strollers, belonging to Messrs. Cibber and Bullock,
      attitudinising and making mouths, as a prologue to the &ldquo;Fall of Bajazet,&rdquo;
       are suddenly surprised into the centre of gravity by the breaking down of
      their scaffold, and Kings, Queens, Turks, tumblers, monkeys, and Merry
      Andrews descend topsy-turvy into a china-shop below! At Lee and Harper's
      grand booth are the celebrated Wooden Horse of Troy, the Temptation of
      Adam and Eve, and Punch's Opera. A fire-eater is devouring his red-hot
      element, and his periwigged Jack-Pud-ding is distributing his quack
      nostrums. A tragedy hero has a brace of bailiffs in his train; and a
      prize-fighter, with his hare sconce dotted with sable patches, and a nose
      that might successfully bob for black-beetles against a brick wall,
      mounted on a blind bone-setter, perambulates the fair, challenging the
      wide world to mortal combat!

      These, with a pretty female drummer of amazonian proportions; an
      equilibrist swinging on the slack rope; a juggler with his cups and balls;
      a pickpocket and a couple of country boobies; a bag-piper; a dancing dog;
      a dwarf drummer, and a music-grinder, make up a dramatis jiersono only to
      be equalled by the Strolling Players * and the March to Finchley.

     * Pannard, a minor French poet, whom Marmontel styles the La
     Fontaine of Vaudeville, has written some verses admirably
     descriptive of an opera behind the scenes.

          &ldquo;J'ai vu le soleil et la lune
          Qui tenoient des discours en l'air:
          J'ai vu le terrible Neptune
          Sortir tout frisé de la mer.
          &ldquo;J'ai vu l'aimable Cythéré
          Au doux regard, au teint fleuri,
          Dans un machine entourée
          D'amours natifs de Chambérie.&rdquo;

     And, after having seen a great number of other things
     equally curious, he concludes with,&mdash;

          &ldquo;J'ai vu des ombres très-palpables Se trémousser aux bords
          du Styx;
          J'ai vu l'enfer et tous les diables A quinze pieds du
          Paradis,&rdquo;

     Some years ago, a strolling company at Ludlow, in
     Shropshire, printed a playbill nearly as large as their
     drop-scene. It announced &ldquo;The Doleful History of King Lear
     and his Three Daughters, with the Merry Conceits of his
     Majesty's Fool, and the valorous exploits of the Duke of
     Gloucester's Bastard; all written by one William
     Shakespeare, a mighty great poet, who was born in
     Warwickshire, and held horses for gentlemen at the sign of
     the Red Bull in St. John's Street, where was just such
     another playhouse as this (I!!), at which we hope the
     company of all friends round the Wrekin.

          &ldquo;All you who would wish to cry or laugh,
          Had better spend your money here than in the alehouse by
          half;
          And if you wish more about these things to know,
          Come at six o'clock to the barn in the High Street, Ludlow,
          Where, presented by live actors, the whole may be seen,
          So Vivat Rex, God save the King, not forgetting the Queen.&rdquo;

     Just as a strolling actor at Newcastle had advertised his
     benefit, a remarkable stranger, no less than the Prince
     Annamaboo arrived, and placarded the town that he granted
     audiences at a shilling a-head. The stroller, without delay,
     waited on the proprietor of the Prince, and for a good round
     sum prevailed on him to command his Serene Highness to
     exhibit his august person on his benefit night. The bills of
     the day announced, that between the acts of the comedy
     Prince Annumaboo would give a lively representation of the
     scalping operation* sound the Indian war-whoop in all its
     melodious tones, practise the tomahawk exercise, and dine à
     la cannibal. An intelligent mob were collected to witness
     these interesting exploits. At the conclusion of the third
     act, his Highness marched forward flourishing his tomahawk,
     and shouting, &ldquo;Ha, ha!&mdash;ho, ho!&rdquo; Next entered a man Avith
     his face blacked, and a piece of bladder fastened to his
     head with gum; the Prince, with an enormous carving-knife,
     began the scalping part of the entertainment, which he
     performed in a truly imperial style, holding up the piece of
     bladder as a token of triumph. Next came the war-whoop, an
     unearthly combination of discordant sounds; and lastly, the
     banquet, consisting of raw beef-steaks, which he rolled up
     into rouleaus, and devoured with right royal avidity. Having
     finished his delicate repast, he wielded his tomahawk in an
     exulting manner, bellowed &ldquo;Ha, ha!&mdash;ho, ho!&rdquo; and made his
     exit. The beneficiare strolling through the marketplace the
     following day, spied the most puissant Prince Annama-boo
     selling pen-knives, scissors, and quills, in the character
     of a Jew pedlar. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the astonished Lord Townley,
     &ldquo;my Prince, is it you? Are you not a pretty circumcised
     little scoundrel to impose upon us in this manner?&rdquo; Moses
     turned round, and with an arch look, replied, &ldquo;Princh be d&mdash;d!
     I vash no Princh; I vash acting, like you. Your troop

      There is a fair,&mdash;an extraordinary one,&mdash;the holding of which
      depends not on the caprice of magisterial wiggery. Jack Frost&mdash;a bold
      fellow! for he has taken Marlborough and Wellington by the nose&mdash;twice
      or thrice in a century proclaims his fair. No sooner is the joyful tidings
      bruited abroad, than the dutiful sons and daughters of Old Father Thames
      flock to his paternal bosom, which, being icy cold, they warm by roasting
      an ox upon it, and then transfer to its glassy surface the turmoil,
      traffic, and monstrosities of dry land.

      Evelyn has given an interesting description of Frost Fair in 1683-4. This
      amusing chronicler of passing events possessed more than Athenian
      curiosity. He entered the penetralia of the court of King Charles the
      Second; and while he whispered in his closet pathetic Jeremiads over its
      immorality, he shocked his averted vision day after day with its
      impurities&mdash;still peeping! still praying! For all and sundry of the
      merry Monarch's &ldquo;misses,&rdquo; and for poor <i>Nelly</i> (by far the best of
      them) in particular, he expressed a becoming horror in his private
      meditations; yet his outward bearing towards them indicated no such
      compunctious visitings. He was an excellent tactician. He crept into the
      privy councils of the regicides, and, <i>mirabile dictu!</i> retired from
      the enemy's camp in a whole skin; and while fortunes were being
      confiscated, and heads were falling on all sides, he kept his own snug in
      his pocket, and erect on his shoulders. Monarchy, Anarchy, High Church,
      Low Church, No Church, Catholicism, Anything-ism, Every-thing-ism.! plain
      John (he declined a baronetcy) passed over the red-hot ploughshares of
      political and religious persecution unsinged. And we rejoice at his good
      luck; for whether he treat of London's great Plague or Fire, the liaisons
      of his &ldquo;kind master&rdquo; King Charles the Second, the naughtiness of Nelly and
      her nymphs, or the ludicrous outbreaks of Southwark, St. Bartholomew, and
      Frost Fairs, he is a delightful, gentlemanly old gossiper!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st of January 1683-4, the cold was so intense, that booths (a
      novel spectacle) were erected on the Thames, and Jack Frost proclaimed his
      earliest recorded fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went crosse the Thames,&rdquo; says Evelyn, January 9, 1683-4, &ldquo;on the ice,
      which now became so thick as to bear not only streetes of boothes, in
      which they roasted meate, and had divers shops of wares, quite acrosse as
      in a towne, but coaches, carts, and horses passed over. So I went from
      Westminster Stay res to Lambeth, and din'd with the Archbishop. I walked
      over the ice (after dinner) from Lambeth Stayres to the Horseferry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Thames (Jany 16) was filled with people and tents, selling all sorts
      of wares as in a citty. The frost (Jany 24) continuing more and more
      severe, the Thames before London was still planned with boothes in formal
      streetes, all sorts of trades and shops furnished and full of commodities,
      even to a printing-presse, where the people and ladyes tooke a fancy to
      have their names printed on the Thames. This humour tooke so universally,
      that 'twas estimated the printer gain'd 51. a-day, for printing a line
      only, at sixpence a name, besides what he got by <i>ballads</i>, &amp;c.
      Coaches plied from Westminster to the Temple, and from several other
      staires to and fro, as in the streetes, sleds, sliding with skeates, a
      bull-baiting, horse and coach races, puppet playes and interludes, cookes,
      tipling, and other lewd places, so that it seem'd to be a bacchanalian
      triumph, or carnival on the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It began to thaw (Feb. 5), but froze againe. My coach crossed from
      Lambeth to the Horseferry at Millbank, Westminster. The booths were almost
      all taken downe; but there was first a map, or landskip, * cut in copper,
      representing all the manner of the camp, and the several actions, sports,
      and pastimes thereon, in memory of so signal a frost.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * These &ldquo;Landskips&rdquo; are interesting, and very difficult to

     Another of these &ldquo;lively Mapps&rdquo; has a full-length portrait
     of Erra Pater, referred to by Hudibras,

          &ldquo;In mathematics he was greater
          Than Tycho Brahe or Erra Pater&rdquo;&mdash;
          prophesying in the midst of the fair.
          &ldquo;Old Erra Pater, or his rambling Ghost,
          Prognosticating of this long strong Frost,
          Some Ages past, said. yl ye Ice-bound Thames

      according to old <i>Erra Pater's</i> prognostication in 1663, is a
      question; and in 1739-40 * he honoured him with a third, which was no less
      joyous than the preceding two. In 1788-9, the Thames was completely frozen
      over below London Bridge. Booths were erected on the ice; and
      puppet-shows, wild beasts, bear-baiting, turnabouts, pigs and sheep
      roasted, exhibited the various amusements of Bartholomew Fair multiplied
      and improved. From Putney Bridge down to Redriff was one continued scene
      of jollity during this seven weeks' saturnalia. The last Frost Fair was
      celebrated in the year 1814. The frost commenced on 27th December 1813,
      and continued to the 5th February 1814. *

     * &ldquo;The River Thames (4th Feby 1814) between London and
     Blackfriars Bridges was yesterday about noon, a perfect
     Dutch Fair. Kitchen fires and furnaces were blazing,
     roasting and boiling in every direction; while animals, from
     a sheep to a rabbit, and a goose to a lark, turned on
     numberless spits. The inscriptions on the several booths and
     lighters were variously whimsical, one of which ran thus:&mdash;
     This Shop to Let. N.B. It is charged with no Land Tax or
     even Ground Tient! Several lighters, lined with baize, and
     decorated with gay streamers, were converted into
     coffeehouses and taverns. About two o'clock a whole sheep
     was roasted on the ice, and cut up, under the inviting
     appellation of Lapland Mutton, at one shilling a slice!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There was a grand walk, or mall, from Blackfriars Bridge to London Bridge,
      that was appropriately named <i>The City Road</i>, and lined on each side
      with booths of all descriptions. Several printing presses were erected,
      and at one of these an orange-coloured standard was hoisted, with &ldquo;<i>Orange
      Boven</i>&rdquo; printed in large characters. There were E O and Rouge et Noir
      tables, tee-totums and skittles; concerts of rough music, viz. salt-boxes
      and rolling-pins, gridirons and tongs, horns, and marrow-bones and
      cleavers. The carousing booths were filled with merry parties, some
      dancing to the sound of the fiddle, others sitting round blazing fires
      smoking and drinking. A printer's devil bawled out to the spectators, Now
      is your time, ladies and gentlemen,&mdash;now is your time to support the
      freedom of the press! * Can the press enjoy greater liberty? Here you find
      it working in the middle of the Thames!&rdquo; And calling upon his operatical

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd now, Eugenio,
      ere we cross the ferry, and mingle with the 'roaring boyes and
      swashbucklers' of St. Bartholomew, let us halt at the <i>Tabard</i>, and
      snatch a brief association with Chaucer and his Pilgrims. The localities
      that were once hallowed by the presence of genius we ardently seek after,
      and fondly trace through all their obscurities, and regard them with as
      true a devotion as does the pilgrim the sacred shrine to which, after his
      patiently-endured perils by sea and land, he offers his adoration. The
      humblest roof gathers glory from the bright spirit that once irradiated
      it; the simplest relic becomes a precious gem, when connected with the
      gifted and the good. We haunt as holy ground the spot where the muse
      inspired our favourite bard; we treasure up his hand-writing in our
      cabinets; we study his works as emanations from the poet; we cherish his
      associations as reminiscences of the man. Never can I forget your
      high-toned enthusiasm when you stood in the solemn chancel of
      Stratford-upon-Avon, pale, breathless, and fixed like marble, before the
      mausoleum of Shakspeare!&rdquo;

      &ldquo;An honest and blithesome spirit was the Father of English Poetry! happy
      in hope, healthful in morals, lofty in imagination, and racy in humour,&mdash;a
      bright earnest of that transcendent genius who, in an after age, shed his
      mighty lustre over the literature of Europe. The <i>Tabard!</i>&mdash;how
      the heart leaps at the sound! What would <i>Uncle Timothy</i> say if he

      One of the most rational pleasures of the intellectual mind is to escape
      from the present to the past. The contemplation of antiquity is replete
      with melancholy interest. The eye wanders with delight over the crumbling
      ruins of ancient magnificence; the heart is touched with some sublime
      emotion; and we ask which is the' most praiseworthy&mdash;the superstition
      that raised these holy temples, or the piety (?) that suffers them to fall
      to decay? This corner is one of my periodical resting-places after a day's
      solitary ramble; for I have many such, in order to brush lip old
      recollections, and lay in fresh mental fuel for a winter evening's
      fireside.'Tis a miracle that this antique fabric should have escaped
      demolition. Look at St. Saviour's! *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  The ancient grave-yard of St. Saviour's contains the
     sacred dust of Massinger. All that the Parish Register
     records of him is, &ldquo;March 20, 1639-40, buried Philip
     Massinger, a Stranger.&rdquo; John Fletcher, the eminent dramatic
     poet, who died of the Plague, August 19,1625, was buried in
     the church.

     With all due respect for Uncle Timothy's opinion, we think
     he is a little too hard upon the citizens, who are not the
     only Vandals in matters of antiquity. The mitre has done its
     part in the work of demolition. Who destroyed the ancient
     palace of the Bishops of Ely, (where &ldquo;Old John of Gaunt,
     time-honour'd Lancaster,&rdquo; breathed his last, in 1398,) with
     its beautiful Chapel and magnificent Gothic Hall? The site
     of its once pleasant garden in Holborn, from whence Richard
     Duke of Gloucester requested a dish of strawberries from the

     Bishop on the morning he sent Lord Hastings to execution, is
     now a rookery of mean hovels. And the Hospital of Saint
     Catherine, and its Collegiate Church,&mdash;where are they? Not
     one stone lies upon another of those unrivalled Gothic
     temples of piety and holiness, founded by the pious Queen
     Matilda. And the ancient Church of St. Bartholomew, where
     once reposed the ashes of Miles Coverdale, and which the
     Great Fire of London spared, is now razed to the ground!

     De Gustibusf Alderman Newman, who had scraped together out
     of the grocery line six hundred thousand pounds, enjoyed no
     greater luxury during the last three years of his life than
     to repair daily to the shop, and, precisely as the clock
     struck two (the good old-fashioned hour of city dining), eat
     his mutton with his successors. The late Thomas Rippon,
     Chief Cashier of the Bank of England, was a similar oddity.
     Onee only, in a service of fifty years, did he venture to
     ask for a fortnight's holiday. He left town, but after a
     three days' unhappy ramble through beautiful green fields,
     he grew moping and melancholy, and prematurely returned to
     the blissful regions of Threadneedle Street to die at his
     desk!

      rightly to estimate the works of man and his Creator,&mdash;the one, like
      himself, stately in pride and beauty, but which pass away as a shadow, and
      are seen no more; the other, the type of divinity, infinite, immutable,
      and eternal.&rdquo;

      Talk of antiquity to a Guildhall Magnifico I * Sirs, I once mentioned the
      'London Stone' to one of these blue-gown gentry, and his one idea
      immediately reverted to the well-known refectory of that venerable name,
      where he stuffs himself to repletion and scarletifies his nasal
      promontory, without a thought of Wat Tyler, * the Lord of the Circle! An
      acquaintance of mine, one Deputy Dewlap, after dining with the

     Tyler. The elements of discord, once put in motion, spread
     abroad with wild fury, till, with the ignoble blood of base
     hinds, mingled the bravest and best in the land. The people
     returned to their subjection wondering and dispirited. For
     whose advantage had all these excesses been committed? Was
     their position raised? Were their grievances redressed,
     their wants alleviated? Did their yoke press lighter? Were
     they nearer the attainment of their (perhaps ''reasonable)
     wishes, by nobility and prelates cruelly slaughtered,
     palaces burned down, and the learning and works of art that
     humanise and soften rugged natures piled in one vast,-
     indiscriminate ruin? If aught was won by these monstrous
     disorders, they were not the winners. The little aristocrats
     of cities, who have thrown their small weight into popular
     insurrections, may have had their vanity gratified and their
     maws temporarily crammed; but the masses, who do the rough
     work of resistance for their more cunning masters, are
     invariably the sufferers and dupes. Hard knocks and hanging
     have hitherto been their reward; and when these shall grow
     out of fashion, doubtless some equally agreeable substitute
     will be found. &ldquo;It is not an obvious way (says Wyndham) for
     making the liquor more clear, to give a shake to the cask,

      tavern, the Tabor, in Gracious (Gracechurch) Street, came in for a share
      of his drolleries. Marvellous must have been the humour of this 'allowed

      paroxysms of concupiscence and ferocity! He was no poll-parrot retailer of
      other people's jokes. He had a wit's treasury of his own, upon which he
      drew liberally, and at sight. His nose was flat; not so his jests; and, in

      On the authority of an old play, &ldquo;The Three Lords and Three Ladies of
      London,&rdquo; published two years after his death, he was originally &ldquo;a,
      water-bearer.&rdquo; Among England's merry crew in the olden time were Will
      Summers, jester to King Henry the Eighth; Patch, Cardinal Wolsey's fool;
      Jack Oates, fool to Sir Richard Hollis; and Archibald Armstrong, jester to
      King Charles the First. There was a famous jester, one Jemy Camber, &ldquo;a fat
      foole,&rdquo; who enlivened the dull Court of James the Sixth of Scotland. The
      manner of his death, as recorded in &ldquo;A Nest of Ninnies,&rdquo; by Robert Armin,
      4to. 1608, is singular. &ldquo;The Chamber-laine was sent to see him there,&rdquo; (at
      the house of a laundress in Edinburgh, whose daughter he was soliciting,
      and who had provided a bed of nettles for his solace,) &ldquo;who when he came
      found him fast asleep under the bed starke naked, bathing in nettles,
      whose skinne when hee wakened him, was all blistered grievously. The
      King's Chamberlaine bid him arise and come to the King. 'I will not,'
      quoth he, 'I will go make my grave.' See how things chanced, he spake
      truer than he was awar. For the Chamberlaine going home without him, tolde
      the King his answere. Jemy rose, made him ready, takes his horse, and
      rides to the church-yard in the high towne, where he found the sexton (as
      the custom is there) making nine graves&mdash;three for men, three for
      women, and three for children; and who so dyes next, first comes, first
      served, * 'Lend mee thy spade,' says Jemy, and with that, digs a hole,
      which hole hee bids him make for his grave; and doth give him a French
      crowne; the man, willing to please him (more for his gold than his
      pleasure) did so: and the foole gets upon his horse, rides to a gentleman
      of the towne, and on the so-daine, within two houres after, dyed: of whom
      the sexton telling, hee was buried there indeed. Thus, you see, fooles
      have a gesse at wit sometime, and the wisest could have done no more, nor
      so much. But thus this fat foole fills a leane grave with his carkasse;
      upon which grave the King caused a stone of marble to bee put, on which
      poets writ these lines in remembrance of him:

      And some capital jokes are recorded of him in this same &ldquo;Nest of Ninnies.&rdquo;
       There was another fool, &ldquo;leane Leonard,&rdquo; who belonged to &ldquo;a kinde
      gentleman&rdquo; in &ldquo;the merry Forrest of Sherwood,&rdquo; a gluttonous fellow, of
      unbounded assurance and ready wit. &ldquo;This leane, greedy foole, having a
      stomaeke, and seeing the butler out of the way, his appetite was such, as
      loath to tarry, he breakes open the dairy-house, eates and spoiles new
      cheeseeurds, cheesecakes, overthrowes creame bowles, and having filled his
      belly, and knew he had done evill, gets him gone to Mansfield in Sherwood,
      as one fearefull to be at home: the maydes came home that morning from
      milking, and finding such a masaker of their dairie, almost mad, thought a
      yeares wages could not make amends: but 'O the foole, leane Leonard,' they
      cryed, 'betid this mischiefe!' They complayned to their master, but to no
      purpose, Leonard was farre inough off; search was made for the foole, but
      hee was gone none new whither, and it was his pro-pertie, having done
      mischiefe, never to come home of himselfe, but if any one intreated him,
      he would easy be won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this while, the foole was at Mansfield in Sherwood, and stood gaping
      at a shoomaker's stall; who, not knowing him, asked him what he was? 'Goe
      look,' says hee; 'I know not my selfe.' They asked him where he was borne?
      'At my mother's backe,' says he.&mdash;'In what country?' quoth they.&mdash;'In
      the country,' quoth he, 'where God is a good man.' At last one of the
      three journeymen imagined he wras not very wise, and flouted him very
      merrily, asking him if he would have a stitch where there was a hole?
      (meaning his mouth.) 'Aye,' quoth the foole, 'if your nose may bee the
      needle.' The shoomaker could have found in his heart to have tooke measure
      on his pate with a last in steede of his foote; but let him goe as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A country plow-jogger being by, noting all this, secretly stole a piece
      of shoomaker's ware off the stall, and coming be-hinde him, clapt him on
      the head, and asked him how he did. The foole, seeing the piteh-ball,
      pulled to have it off, but could not but with much paine, in an envious
      spleene, smarting ripe, runs after him, fais at fistie cuffes with, but
      the fellow belaboured the foole cunningly, and got the foole's head under
      his arme, and bobb'd his nose. The foole remembering how his head was,
      strikes it up, and hits the fellowes mouth with the pitcht place, so that
      the haire of his head, and the haire of the clownes beard were glued
      together. The fellow cryed, the foole exclaimed, and could not sodanely
      part. In the end the people (after much laughing at the jest) let them
      part faire; the one went to picke his beard, the other his head. The
      constable came, and asked the cause of their falling out, and knowing one
      to be Leonard the leane foole, whom hee had a warrant for from the
      gentleman to search for, demaunds of the fellow how it hapned? The fellow
      hee could answere nothing but 4 um&mdash;um,' for his mouth was sealed up
      with wax, 'Dost thou scorne to speake V says hee. 41 am the King's
      officer, knave!' 6 Um&mdash;um,' quoth hee againe. Meaning hee would tell
      him all when his mouth was cleane. But the constable, thinking hee was
      mockt, clapt him in the stocks, where the fellow sate a long houre farming
      his mouth, and when hee had done, and might tell his griefe, the constable
      was gone to carry home Leonard to his maister; who, not at home, hee was
      enforced to stay supper time, where hee told the gentleman the jest, who
      was very merry to heare the story, contented the offieer, and had him to
      set the fellow at liberty, who betimes in the morning was found fast
      asleep in the stocks. The fellow knowing himselfe faulty, put up his
      wrongs, quickly departed, and went to work betimes that morning with a
      flea in his eare.&rdquo;

      Could we sit at the Tabard, and not remember the Globe, * with its flag
      floating in the air, the Boar's Head, and the Falcon!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  &ldquo;Each playhouse,&rdquo; says W. Parkes, in his Curtain-drawer
     of the World, 4to. 1612, &ldquo;advaneeth its flag in the air,
     whither, quickly, at the waving thereof, are summoned whole
     troops of men, women, and children.&rdquo; And William Rowley, in
     &ldquo;A Search for Money, 1609,&rdquo; whilst enumerating the many
     strange characters assembled at a tavern in quest of &ldquo;The
     Wandering Knight, Monsieur L'Argent,&rdquo; includes among them
     four or five flag-falne plaiers, poore harmlesse merrie
     knaves, that were now neither lords nor ladies, but honestly
     wore their owne clothes (if they were paid for.)

     In 1698 an unsuccessful attempt was made by the puritanical
     vestry of Saint Saviour's to put down the Globe Theatre, on
     the plea of the &ldquo;enormities&rdquo; practised there. But James the
     First, when he came to the throne, knocked their petitions
     on the head by granting his patent to Shakspere and others
     to perform plays, &ldquo;as well within their usuall house called
     the Globe, in Surry,&rdquo; as elsewhere. It was what Stowe calls
     &ldquo;a frame of timber,&rdquo; with, according to John Taylor, the
     water-poet, &ldquo;a thatched hide.&rdquo; Its sign was an Atlas bearing
     a globe. It was accidentally burnt down on St. Peter's day,
     June 29, 1613. &ldquo;And a marvaile and fair grace of God it
     was,&rdquo; says Sir Ralph Win wood in his Memorials, &ldquo;that the
     people had so little harm, having but two little doors to
     get out.&rdquo;

     Sir Henry Wootton's relation of this fire is exceedingly
     interesting. &ldquo;Now, to let matters of state sleep, I will
     entertain you at the present with what hath happened this
     week at the Banks side. The King's players had a new play,
     called All is true, representing some principal pieces of
     the raign of Henry 8 which was set forth with many
     extraordinary circumstances of pomp and majesty, even to the
     matting of the stage, the knights of the order, with their
     Georges and garters, the guards with their embroidered
     coats, and the like: sufficient, in truth, within a mile to
     make greatness very familiar, if not ridiculous. Now King
     Henry making a masque at the Cardinal Woolsey's house, and
     certain canons being shot off at his entry, some of the
     paper, or other stuff wherewith one of them were stopped,
     did light on the thatch, where, being thought at first but
     an idle smoak, and their eyes more attentive to the show, it
     kindled inwardly, and ran round like a train, consuming
     within less than an hour the whole house to the very ground.

     &ldquo;This was the fatal period of that vertuous fabrique,
     wherein nothing did perish but wood and straw, and a few
     forsaken cloaks; only one man had his breeches set on fire,
     that would perhaps have broyled him if he had not, by the
     benefit of a provident wit, put it out with bottle-ale. The
     rest when we meet.&rdquo;&mdash;Reliquio Woottonio.

      Suddenly the strings of a harp were struck. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy,
      &ldquo;that is no everyday hand.&rdquo;

      The chords were repeated; and, after a symphony that spoke in exquisite

      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy, and his eye glistened and his lip

      night, as perchance it hath been of many long since silent and unstrung.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;An arrant Proteus!&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy, &ldquo;with the harp of Urien, and the
      knavery of Autolicus. But we must have him in, and see what further store
      of ballads he hath in his budget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he rose a second time; but was anticipated by the Squire Minstrel, who
      entered, crying, &ldquo;Largess! gentles, largess! for the poor harper of merry
      Stratford-upon-Avon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The personage making this demand was enveloped in a large, loose camlet
      cloak, that had evidently passed through several generations of his craft
      till it descended to the shortest. His complexion was of a brickdust
      rosiness, through which shone dirtiness visible; his upper-lip was
      fortified with a huge pair of sable mustachios, and his nether curled
      fiercely with a bushy imperial. His eyes, peering under his broad-brimmed
      slouched beaver, were intelligent, and twinkled with good humour. His
      voice, like his figure, was round and oily; and when he doffed his hat, a
      shock of coal-black wiry hair fell over his face, and rendered his
      features still more obscure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, goodman Harper,&rdquo; cried Uncle Timothy, after viewing attentively
      this singular character, &ldquo;what other Fittes, yet unsung, have you in your

      drink too, for the best wit in Christendom, past, present, and to come!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Tarlton was a poet. &ldquo;Tarlton's Toys&rdquo; (see Thomas Nash's
     &ldquo;Terrors of the Night,&rdquo; 4to. 1594,) had appeared in 1586. He
     had some share in the extemporal play of &ldquo;The Seven Deadly
     Sins.&rdquo; In 1578, John Allde had a licence to publish
     &ldquo;Tarlton's device upon this unlooked-for great snowe.&rdquo; In
     1570, the same John Allde &ldquo;at the long shop adjoyning unto
     Saint Mildred's Church in the Pultrye,&rdquo; published &ldquo;A very
     Lamentable and Wofull Discours of the Fierce Fluds, which
     lately Flowed in Bedford Shire, in Lincoln Shire, and in
     many other Places, with the Great Losses of Sheep and other
     Cattel, the 5th of October, 1570.&rdquo; We are in possession of
     an unique black-letter ballad, written by Tarlto. It has
     a woodcut of a lady dressed in the full court costume of the
     time, holding in her right hand a fan of feathers.

     &ldquo;A prettie newe Ballad, intytuled:

     The crowe sits upon the wall,

     Please one and please all.

     To the tune of, 'Please one and please all.'

     Imprinted at London for Henry Kyrkham, dwelling at the
     little North doore of Paules, at. the Sygne of the blacke
     Boys.&rdquo; Tarlton's wife, Kate, was a shrew; and, if his own
     epigram be sooth, a quean into the bargain.

          &ldquo;Woe to thee, Tarjton, that ever thou were born,
          Thy wife hath made thee a cuckold, and thou must wear the
          horn:
          What, and if she hath? Am I a whit the worse?
          She keeps me like a gentleman, with money in my purse.&rdquo;

     He was not always so enduring and complaisant: for on one
     occasion, in a storm, he proposed, to lighten the vessel by
     throwing his lady overboard!
</pre>
    <p>
      Thy calling, vagrant though it be, shall not stand in the way of a good
      toast. What say you, my friends, to a loving cup with the harper, to Dick
      Tarlton, and Merrie England? The cup went round; and as the harper brushed
      his lips after the spicy draught, so did his right mustachio!
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Timothy did not notice this peculiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I once more presume, my noble masters,&rdquo; said the harper. &ldquo;I would
      humbly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art Lord of Misrule for to-night,&rdquo; replied Uncle Timothy. &ldquo;Go on
      presuming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The memory of the immortal Twenty-nine, and their patron, Holy Saint
      Thomas of Canterbury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the minstrel bowed his head reverently, crossed his hands over his
      breast, and rising to his harp, struck a chord that made every bosom
      thrill again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy touch hath a finish, and thy voice a harmony that betoken cultivation
      and science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the middle-aged gentleman made this observation, the mustachio that had
      taken a downward curve, fell to the ground; its companion, (some
      conjuror's heir-loom,) played at follow my leader; and the solitary
      imperial was left alone in its glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harper, to hide his confusion, hummed Lo-doiska.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Timothy, espying the phenomenon, fixed his wondering eyes full in
      the strange man's face, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Who, and what art thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a palmer come from the Holy Land.&rdquo; (<i>Singing.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless!&rdquo; replied Uncle Timothy. &ldquo;A palmer of traveller's tales upon
      such ignoramuses as will believe them. Why, that mysterious budget of
      thine contains every black-letter rarity that Captain Cox * of Coventry
      rejoiced in, and bibliomaniacs sigh for. Who, and what art thou?&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Laneham, in his Account of the Queen's Entertainment at
     Killingworth Castle, 1575, represents this military mason
     and bibliomaniac as &ldquo;marching on valiantly before, clean
     trust, and gartered above the knee, all fresh in a velvet

      &ldquo;Or, suppose&mdash;<i>Uncle Timothy!</i>&rdquo; Here, with the adroitness of a

      wig thrown off, the bushy imperial sent to look after the stray
      mustachios, the thread-bare camlet cloak and rusty beaver cast aside, and
      the chaffing quaffing, loud-laughing Lauréat of Little Britain stood
      confessed under a stucco of red ochre!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there ever such a mountebank varlet!&rdquo; shouted the middle-aged
      gentleman, holding fast his two sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I followed close upon your skirts, and dogged you hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dogged me, puppy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Moses, the old clothesman, provided my mendicant wardrobe, and mine
      host lent the harp, which belongs to an itinerant musician, who charms his
      parlour company with sweet sounds. I intended, dear Uncle Timothy, to
      surprise and please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in truth, Benjamin, thou hast done both. I am surprised and pleased!&rdquo;
       And drawing nearer, with a suppressed voice, he added, &ldquo;When sick and
      sorrowful, sing me that old harper's song. When thou only art left to
      smooth my pillow, and close my eyes sing me that old harper's song!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      ''Twill make me pass the cup of anguish by,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Mix with the blest, nor know that I had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Jacob Jollyboy,to plot against me with that Israelitish retailer
      of cast-off duds, Mr. Moses!&rdquo; continued the satirical-nosed gentleman,
      labouring hard to conceal his emotion under a taking-to-task frown
      exceedingly imposing and ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jollyboy looked all confusion and cutlets.. &ldquo;Where do you expect to go
      when you die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where Uncle Timothy goes, and '<i>je suis content</i>, 'as the Frenchman
      said to not half so dainty a dish of smoking-hot Scotch collops as I have
      the honour to set before you.&rdquo; And Mr. Jollyboy breathed, or rather puffed
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lauréat,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Neat, trimly drest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Fresh as a bridegroom,&rdquo; and his face new wash'd,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      re-entered, and with his usual urbanity did the honours of the
      supper-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotch collops having been despatched with hearty good will, Uncle
      Timothy restricted our future libations to one single bowl. &ldquo;And mind,
      Benjamin, only one!&rdquo; This was delivered with peculiar emphasis. Mr. Bosky
      bowed obedience to the behest; and, as a nod is as good as a wink, he <i>nodded</i>
      to Mr. Jollyboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bowl was brought in, brimming and beautiful; and it was five good acts
      of a comedy to watch the features of Uncle Timothy. He first gazed at the
      bowl, then at the landlord, then at the lauréat, then at us, and then at
      the bowl again!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Mr. Jollyboy,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;call you this a bowl, or a caldron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jollyboy solemnly deposed as to its being a real bowl; the identical
      bowl in which six little Jollyboys had been christened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your intention, Mr. Jollyboy, to christen us too? Let it be
      tipplers, then, mine host of the Tabard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the christening, Uncle Timothy, that would be nothing very much out
      of order&mdash;seeing
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That some great poet says, I'll take my oath,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Man is an infant, but of larger growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; argued Mr. Bosky, Socratically, the <i>dimensions</i> of the
      bowl were not in the record; and as I thought we should be too many for a
      halfcrown sneaker of punch-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought you would be too many for me! And so you have been. Sit down,
      Mr. Jollyboy, and help us out of this dilemma. Take a drop of your own
      physic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jollyboy respectfully intimated he would rather do that than break his
      arm; and took his seat at the board accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy, &ldquo;let us have the entire <i>dramatis personæ</i>
      of the harper's interlude. We are minus his groom of the stole. Send our
      compliments over the way for Mr. Moses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Moses was summoned, and he sidled in with a very high stock, with
      broad pink stripes, and a very low bow&mdash;hoping &ldquo;de gentlemensh vash
      quite veil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bosky, &ldquo;we are not all mustered. The harp!&rdquo; And
      instantly the lauréat &ldquo;with flying fingers touched the&rdquo; wires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A song from Uncle Timothy, for which the musical bells of St. Saviour's
      tell us there is just time.&rdquo; He then struck the instrument to a lively
      tune, and the middle-aged gentleman sang with appropriate feeling,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;THE TABARD.
    </h3>
    <p class="indent10">
      &ldquo;Old Tabard! those time-honour'd timbers of thine.

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ethinks,
      Benjamin,&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy to the lauréat of Little Britain, as they
      sat <i>tête-à-tête</i> at breakfast on the morning after the adventure of
      the old harper,&mdash;&ldquo;methinks I have conceded quite enough by consenting
      to play Esquire Bedel to the Fubsys, Muffs, and Flumgartens. A couple of
      lean barn-door fowls and a loin&mdash;or, as Mrs. Flumgarten classically
      spells it, a lion of fat country pork at Christmas, even were I a more
      farinaceous feeder than I am, are hardly equivalent to my approaching
      purgatory. You bargained, among other sights, for Westminster Abbey. Now
      what possible charm can the <i>Poet's Corner</i> have for the Fubsy
      family, who detest poets and poetry quite as much as ever did the second
      George 'boedry and bainding!' Then came the British Museum. I will now
      take leave to have my own way. Your eloquence, persuasive though it be,
      shall never talk me into a new blue coat and brass buttons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, Uncle Timothy, Mrs Flurngarten will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Benjamin. That full-blown hollyhock of the aristocracy of
      Mammon, who has a happy knack of picking a hole in everybody's coat, will
      not spare mine. Let her then, for economy's sake, pick a hole in an old
      coat rather than a new one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The honour of our family is at stake,&rdquo; urged the lauréat. &ldquo;Respect, too,
      for Mrs. Flumgar-ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Timothy whistled
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Sic a wife as Willie had,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I would na gie a button for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose, Benjamin, I should be so insane so stark, staring,
      ridiculously mad.&rdquo; Here
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Timothy paused to see what effect his budget of suppositions had
      upon Mr Bosky's nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Bosky kept his nerves well strung and his countenance steady, and
      let Uncle Timothy go on supposing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I should all at once depart from the sober gravity that belongs
      to my years, and exhibit myself in a blue coat and brass buttons&mdash;&rdquo;
       Uncle Timothy again paused; but he might as well have whistled jigs to a
      milestone. The lauréat continued immoveable and mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benjamin&mdash;Benjamin <i>Bosky!</i>&rdquo; cried Uncle Timothy, nettled at
      his provoking imperturbability, &ldquo;if, out of a mistaken civility to your
      country cousins, and to rid myself of these annoying importunities, I
      should invite the caricaturist to pillory me in the print-shops&mdash;a
      blue coat and brass buttons are not the journey-work of twenty minutes&mdash;for
      by that time I must be equipped to start: And, to swaddle myself in a
      ready-made fit, too long at the top, and too short at the bottom&mdash;like
      the Irishman's blanket! No, Benjamin Bosky! For, though of figure I have
      nothing to boast&mdash;&rdquo; here Uncle Timothy unconsciously (?) glanced at
      his comely person in a mirror&mdash;&ldquo;I do not intend to qualify myself for
      a chair on the fifth of November.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bosky still maintained a respectful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, Benjamin, were I inclined to forego my scruples, and oblige
      you for this once&rdquo;&mdash;as Uncle Timothy saw the apparent impossibility
      of obliging, he spoke more freely of his possible compliance&mdash;&ldquo;the
      thing, you see, is absolutely impracticable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bosky looked anxiously at the clock, and Uncle Tim quite exulted that,
      while starting an insurmountable obstacle, he had dexterously&mdash;handsomely
      slipped out of a scrape.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a tap was heard at the door, and the old-fashioned
      housekeeper&mdash;a sort of animated dumb-waiter&mdash;brought in a blue
      bag for Uncle Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A carpet-bag is generally significant of its contents. Though now and then
      things not legitimately belonging to it will creep into a carpet-bag. But
      in a blue bag there is more room for conjecture. A very equivocal thing is
      a blue bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Timothy, after reading the direction thrice over, untied the blue
      bag, dived his hand in for its contents, and the first thing he fished up
      was a bran new blue coat, with brilliant brass buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      After turning the garment round and round and examining it attentively, he
      laid it aside, dived again and captured a rich black satin waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waistcoat underwent a similar scrutiny, and then took its station
      beside the blue coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third dive brought to the surface a claret-coloured pair of
      continuations of a very quiet and becoming cut, to which was pinned a
      respectful note from Mr. Rufus Rumfit of Red Lion Square, stating that the
      suit had been made exactly to measure, and hoping that it would meet with
      Uncle Timothy's approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Benjamin,&rdquo; inquired the satirical-nosed gentleman, &ldquo;is this Rufus
      Rumfit at all given to drink? He talks of having taken my measure: he had
      surely taken more than his own when he hazarded such an assertion. Some
      would-be old beau&mdash;for the habiliments, I see, are of a mature
      fashion&mdash;is burning to disguise his person in this harlequin suit. My
      life on't, Mr. Rumfit will soon discover his mistake and be back again.&rdquo;
       And' Uncle Timothy began to tumble the blue coat, black satin waistcoat,
      and claret-coloured continuations into the blue bag with all speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clock strikes. I have no time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this exhumation of Mr. Rumfit's handiwork, the Lauréat of Little
      Britain had been coaxing a favourite parrot, with whom he generally held
      converse at breakfast time, to talk: but the unusual sight of so much
      finery had completely absorbed Poll's attention, and he remained
      obstinately silent, leaving Mr. Bosky to tax his ingenuity how to prevent
      laughing outright in Uncle Timothy's face. But the affair admitting of no
      longer delay, he threw himself into a theatrical posture, and exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Thou wert not wont to be so dull, good Tyrrel.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the scales fell from the middle-aged gentleman's eyes, and
      he exclaimed seriously, and trying to look reproachfully, &ldquo;This, Benjamin,
      is another of your Tomfooleries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bosky pleaded guilty; but urged, in mitigation, the rusty old black,
      and the brilliant bright blue: concluding with a glowing panegyric on the
      <i>tout ensemble</i>, which he declared to be the masterpiece of Mr.
      Rumfit's thimble and shears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Timothy was in no humour to put himself out of one: and when, after
      a few minutes trying on the suit in his tiring-room, <i>just to see</i>&mdash;out
      of mere curiosity&mdash;if it <i>did</i> fit, he returned in full
      pontificalibus, a middle-aged Adonis! he seemed moderately reconciled to
      his new metamorphosis, and rang for the old-fashioned housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norah Noclack was a woman of few words. On her entrance she started,
      stared amazedly, and uttered the interjection, &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; with the further
      additions of &ldquo;Well, I'm sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;That with a cap and bells, a dark lantern, a pasteboard red nose,
      a chair, and half a score of ragged urchins to shout me an ovation, I
      should make an undeniable old Guy! Eh, Norah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ancient housekeeper shook her antediluvian high-crowned cap and
      streamers in token of dissent, and Mr. Bosky was unutterably shocked at
      the impossible idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; added Uncle Timothy, strutting to and fro with mock dignity,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;'Since I am crept in favour with myself,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I will maintain it with some little cost!'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Norah, run and buy me sixpenny-worth of flowers to stick in my
      button-hole. No dahlias, or hollyhocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bosky suggested a sunflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The satirical-nosed gentleman looked a trifle serious, and the lauréat
      stood self-reproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norah Noclack soon returned with a modest little bouquet, consisting of a
      last rose of summer, a violet or two, and, what was peculiarly
      appropriate, heartease.
    </p>
    <p>
      A contest had very nearly arisen about Doctor Johnson's club, as Mr. Bosky
      irreverently called it, which was Uncle Timothy's constant companion. This
      valued relic had been <i>accidentally</i> mislaid, and there being no time
      to look for it, a handsome black cane, with a gold top and silk tassel,
      was its substitute. Mr. Bosky then dutifully tendered him a smart new
      beaver, intimating that the old one had that morning been converted into a
      nursery by his favourite pepper-and-salt puss. At this crowning specimen
      of the laureates ingenuity, Uncle Timothy smiled graciously, and being now
      gaily equipped, prepared to sally forth, when a knock of some pretension
      announced the presence of the august brotherin-law of Mrs. Flumgarten, one
      of the pleasure-taking tormentors of Uncle Timothy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; muttered the middle-aged gentleman. &ldquo;The deuce,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
      dickens,&rdquo; &ldquo;rabbit it,&rdquo; &ldquo;drabbit it,&rdquo; &ldquo;boddikins,&rdquo; or when anything
      intolerably queer excited him, &ldquo;od's boddikins!&rdquo; were the only expletives
      that escaped from the lips of Uncle Timothy. But &ldquo;the devil!&rdquo; Even Mr.
      Bosky looked momentarily aghast, and the old-fashioned housekeeper,
      shaking her head and shrugging up her shoulders, attributed the appalling
      words to the supernatural influence of the blue coat and brass buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmin' vether this is! Fine hautum mornin's these are!&rdquo; grinned Mr.
      Muff (his tongue too big for his mouth, and his teeth too many for his
      tongue,) with a consequential, self-satisfied air, that seemed to say,
      &ldquo;Beat that if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Timothy coolly remarked that the sun was just out; and Mr. Bosky,
      that the post was just in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ven I began to dress me the vind was nor'-nor'-east, but it soon changed
      to sow-sow-west,&rdquo; was the next profound remark volunteered by Mr. Muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the lauréat, &ldquo;you and the wind shifted at much about the same
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Muffs, Fubsys, and Flumgartens, could not understand a joke, which
      they always took the wrong way. The intelligent master mason, nothing
      moved, inquired, Anything new in <i>Lit-tie Britain?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The barber's freshly painted <i>pole</i> * over the way,&rdquo; replied Mr.
      Bosky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or in <i>Great Britain?</i>&rdquo; continued Mr. Muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>moon</i>,&rdquo; rejoined Uncle Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brother-in-law of Mrs. Flumgarten was at a dead lock.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The barber's pole, one of the popular relics of Merrie
     England, is still to be seen in some of the old streets of
     London and in country-towns, painted with its red, blue, and
     yellow stripes, and surmounted with a gilt acorn. The lute
     and violin were formerly among the furniture of a barber's
     shop. He who waited to be trimmed, if of a musical turn,
     played to the company. The barber himself was a nimble-
     tongued, pleasant-witted fellow. William Rowley, the
     dramatist, in &ldquo;A Search for Money, 1609,&rdquo; thus describes
     him:&mdash;&ldquo;As wee were but asking the question, steps me from
     over the way ( over-listning us) a news-searcher, viz. a
     barber: he, hoping to at-taine some discourse for his next
     patient, left his banner of basons swinging in the ayre, and
     closely eave-drops our conference. The saucie treble-tongu'd
     knave would insert somewhat of his knowledge (treble-tongu'd
     I call him, and thus I prove 't: hee has a reasonable
     mother-tongue, his barber-sur-gions tongue; and a tongue
     betweene two of his fingers, and from thence proceeds his
     wit, and 'tis a snapping wit too). Well, sir, he (before he
     was askt the question,) told us that the wandring knight
     (Monsier L'Argent) sure was not farre off; for on Saterday-
     night he was faine to watch till morning to trim some of his
     followers, and its morning they went away from him betimes.
     Hee swore hee never clos'd his eyes till hee came to church,
     and then he slept all sermon-time; but certainly hee is not
     farre afore, and at yonder taverne (showing us the bush) I
     doe imagine he has tane a chamber.&rdquo; In ancient times the
     barber and the tailor, as news-mongers, divided the crown.
     The barber not only erected his pole as a sign, but hung his
     basins upon it by way of ornament.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sounding the depths of his capacious intellect, his cogitative faculties
      were &ldquo;in cogibundity of cogitation.&rdquo; He soon rallied with, &ldquo;How's the
      generality of things in general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now Uncle Timothy's and Mr. Bosky's turn to be posed! But the
      interrogator relieved them by suddenly recollecting the object of his
      mission&mdash;&ldquo;I'm come, Mister Timviddy-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, sir, you mean to address me,&rdquo; said the satirical-nosed gentleman, &ldquo;my
      name is not Timwiddy, but-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Timkins,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you please,&rdquo; rejoined Uncle Timothy, with the most contemptuous
      acquiescence. &ldquo;Call me Alexander, Wat Tyler, Abelard, Joe Grimaldi, Scipio
      Africanus, Martin Van Butchell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ve vont quarrel about Christun names, Mister Timtiffin. Plain Timvig vill
      do for me. The Muffs and all that's a-skin to'em is not over-purtickler
      about names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the poll parrot, that had been listening to and scrutinizing the
      intruder from head to foot, struck up the old song,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Don't you know the muffin man!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Don't you know his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A comical sort of a bird that is!&rdquo; remarked the master mason. &ldquo;I'm come,
      I say, Mister Tumvhim to fetch you to Mrs. Flumgarten; for she says it's
      werry mystified, but you gay-looking, dandyfied, middle-aged gentlemen,
      (Mrs. Flumgarten hates gay-looking, dandified, middle-aged gentlemen,) are
      awful loiterers by the vay. You can't see a smart bonnet or a pretty
      turn'd ankle, but you old galhant gay Lotharios must stop and look
      after'em; and that, she says, is werry low&mdash;and the Muffs, Fubsys,
      and Flumgartens hates vhat's low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Timothy made a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Flumgarten von't go to the Museum: she could abide the stuffed birds
      and monkeys; but she can't a-bear old war-ses, and old bronze-eyes. She
      hates, too, them Algerine (Elgin?) marbles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The middle-aged gentleman inwardly rejoiced at Mrs. Flumgarten's
      antipathies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she von't go to the play, for Mrs. Flumgarten hates your acting
      nonsensical mock stuff; and she don't think she'll go to the Fancy Fair,
      for Mrs. Flumgarten&mdash;it's wery funny that&mdash;hates fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Mr. Bosky's Louis Quatorze clock struck a musical quarter,
      and the parrot responded with two lines from one of the laureat's lyrics;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Quick! quick! be off in a crack;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Cut your stick, or'twill be on your back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and a tag (the schoolmaster had been abroad in Little Britain!) for which
      my Lord Mayor&mdash;the conservator of city morals and the Thames&mdash;would
      have fined him five shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Poll parrot swears like a Chrishtun!&rdquo; Mr. Muff then took hold of
      Uncle Timothy's arm, adding, &ldquo;If ye don't make haste, Mrs. Flumgarten vill
      look as bitter as a duck biled vith camomile-flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Within my solitary bow'r
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I saw a quarter of an hour
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Fly heavily along!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bosky's quarter flew by the &ldquo;fast flying waggon that flies on broad
      wheels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! 'no creature smarts so little as a fool.' Well said, Alexander
      the Little! Poll&mdash;pretty Poll!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Pretty Poll! let's you and I
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Something merry and musical try,
    </p>

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But Poll's eyes still goggled at the door through which Uncle Tim and his
      finery had vanished. An almond or two from that <i>magazin de comfitures</i>,
      Mr. Bosky's waistcoat pocket, soon revived in the abstracted bird a relish
      for the good things of this world. He wetted his whistle cordially with a
      spoonful of maraschino, and sharpening his beak against the wires of his
      cage, presented it for a salute. He then gave token of a song, and the
      lauréat led, to the tune of the &ldquo;<i>Dandy O!</i>&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Lauréat of
      Little Britain was now left at liberty to follow his daily avocations; but
      that liberty was no guarantee that he would follow them; except, as some
      folks follow the fashions, at a considerable distance. He read the morning
      papers, went upon 'Change, inquired the price of stocks, set his watch by
      the dial of Bow Church, returned home, turned over the leaves of his
      ledger, hummed, whistled, poked the fire, scribbled on the blotting-paper,
      and cracked a joke with his solemn clerk. Still, with all these
      manifestations of being mightily busy about doing nothing, it was obvious
      that his wits were running a wild goose chase after Uncle Timothy's new
      blue coat and brass buttons. But the oddest is behind. Mrs. Norah Noclack
      suddenly betrayed unwonted symptoms of vocality. Her first notes fell on
      the astonished ear of the solemn clerk, and served him as the ghost of
      Banquo did Macbeth&mdash;pushed him from his stool. He hurried to the
      stair-head, marvelling what musical coil could be going on in the
      still-room. He next applied his oblique eye to the key-hole, and,&mdash;seeing
      is believing,&mdash;beheld the locomotive old lass rehearsing a minuet
      before the mirror, to the chromatic accompaniment of her wiry falsetto.
      Big with the portentous discovery, he bustled to Mr. Bosky, to whom, after
      unpacking his budget of strange news, he proposed the instant holding of a
      commission of lunacy, for the due and proper administration of her few
      hundreds in long annuities, two large boxes, and a chest of drawers, full
      of old-fashioned finery, besides sundry trinkets, the spoils of three
      courtships.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after, the carolling of Mrs. Norah surprised Uncle Timothy, who
      recognising the real culprit in the eccentric muse of Mr. Benjamin Bosky,
      he took the lauréat to task for putting his wardrobe into metre, hitching
      his Christian name into ludicrous rhyme, and turning the head and untuning
      the voice of the hitherto anti-musical Norah Noclack. Mr. Bosky exhibited
      deep contrition, but as Mr. Bosky's contrition bore considerable
      resemblance to Mr. Liston's tragedy, Uncle Timothy always dreaded to
      encounter it when anything serious was in the case. And so completely did
      the old chantress inoculate the solemn clerk with her musical mania, that
      one evening, when called upon for a toast and a song at the club * of the
      Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, held in an ancient trophied chamber over
      the venerable gateway of the Priory, he startled his brother knights with
      his unwonted enthusiasm. &ldquo;Uncle Timothy! Sound trumpets! wave banners!
      shout voices!&rdquo; This was the longest public oration that Mr. Fixture had
      made in his life. Certainly the only song that he was ever known to have
      sung was the old-fashioned housekeeper's&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This club consists of more than fifteen hundred members.
     Their orgies are celebrated every Monday evening throughout
     the year. The chair is taken at nine, and vacated at twelve.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>entle Reader! we
      promised thee at the outset of our journey pleasant companions by the way,
      and as an earnest of that promise, we have introduced Benjamin Bosky and
      Uncle Tim. We would now bespeak thy courtesy for others that are soon to
      follow. In passing happily through life, half the battle depends upon the
      persons with whom we may be associated. And shall we carry spleen into the
      closet?&mdash;grope for that daily plague in our books, when it elbows and
      stares us in the face at every turn? To chronicle the &ldquo;Painful
      Peregrinations&rdquo; of Uncle Timothy through this livelong day, would exhibit
      him, like &ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; not sitting &ldquo;on a monument, smiling at grief,&rdquo; but
      lolling in Mr. Bosky's britschka, laughing (in his sleeve!) at the strange
      peculiarities of the Muffs, and listening with mild endurance to the
      unaccountable antipathies of Mrs. Flumgarten. Now the Fubsys might be
      called, <i>par excellence</i>, a prudent family.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Prudence is a nymph we much admire,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She loves to aid the hypocrite and liar,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Helping poor rascals through the mire,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Whom filth and infamy begrime:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She's one of guilt's most useful drudges,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Her good advice she never grudges,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gives parsons meekness, gravity to judges;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But frowns upon the man of rhyme!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Good store of prudence had the Fubsy family. Their honest scruples always
      prevented them from burning their fingers. They were much too wise to walk
      into a well. They kept on the windy side of the law. They were vastly
      prone to measure other people's morality by the family bushel, and had
      exceedingly grand notions touching their self-importance; (little minds,
      like little men, cannot afford to stoop!) which those who have seen a cock
      on a dunghill, or a crow in a gutter, may have some idea of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing pleased Mrs. Flumgarten. Mr. Bosky's equipage she politely brought
      into depreciating comparison with the staring yellow and blue,
      brass-mounted, and screw-wigged turn-out of her acquaintances the <i>Kickwitches</i>,
      the mushroom aristocracy of retired &ldquo;Putty and Lead!&rdquo; And when Mr. Muff,
      who was no herald, hearing something about Mr. Bosky's <i>arms</i> being
      painted on the panels, innocently inquired whether his <i>legs</i> were
      not painted too?&mdash;at which Uncle Timothy involuntarily smiled&mdash;the
      scarlet-liveried pride of the Fubsys rushed into her cheeks, and she
      bridled up, wondering what there was in Mr. Muffs question to be laughed
      at. Knowing the susceptibility of Mrs. Flumgarten's nervous system, Uncle
      Timothy desired John Tomkins to drive moderately slow. This was
      &ldquo;scratching away at a snail's pace! a cat's gallop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little faster, John,&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy, mildly. This was racing along
      like &ldquo;Sabbath-day, pleasure-taking, public-house people in a tax-cart!&rdquo;
       Not an exhibition, prospect, person, or thing, were to her mind. The
      dinner, which might have satisfied Apicius, she dismissed with &ldquo;faint
      praise,&rdquo; sighing a supplementary complaint, by way of errata, that there &ldquo;<i>was
      no pickles!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and the carving&mdash;until the well-bred Mrs.
      Flumgarten snatched the knife and fork out of Uncle Timothy's hands&mdash;was
      &ldquo;awful! horrid!&rdquo; Then she never tastes <i>such</i> sherry as she does at
      her cousins' the <i>Shufflebothams</i>; and as for their black amber
      (Hambro'?) grapes, oh! they was fit for your perfect gentlefolks!&mdash;An
      inquiry from mine host, whether Uncle Timothy preferred a light or a full
      wine, drew forth this jocular answer, &ldquo;I like a full wine, and a full
      bottle, Master Boniface.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added the unguarded Mr. Muff.
      This was &ldquo;tremendious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies looked at each other, and having decided on a joint scowl,
      it fell with annihilating blackness on the master-mason, and Mrs. Muff
      trod upon his toes under the table, a conjugal hint that Mr. Muff had
      taken enough! Mrs. Flumgarten had a momentary tiff with Mrs. Muff upon
      some trifling family jealousy, which brought into contest their diminutive
      dignities; but as the fond sisters had the good fortune to be Fubsys, and
      as the Fubsys enjoyed the exclusive privilege of abusing one another with
      impunity, the sarcastic compliments and ironical sneers they so lovingly
      exchanged passed for nothing after the first fire. The absence of Mr.
      Flumgarten, a scholar and a gentleman, who had backed out of this party of
      pleasure, (?) left his lady at a sad loss for one favourite subject in
      which she revelled, because it annoyed him; consequently there were no
      vulgar impertinent hits at &ldquo;your clever people!&rdquo; This hiatus led to some
      melancholy details of what she had suffered during her matrimonial
      pilgrimage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suffered!&rdquo; muttered the middle-aged gentleman, indignantly. &ldquo;Yes, Madam
      Zantippe, you have suffered! But what? Why, your greeneyed illiterate
      prejudices to mar all that makes the domestic hearth intellectual and
      happy! Yes! you have reduced it to a cheerless desert, where you reign the
      restless fury of contradiction and discord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Guy Muff, the eldest born of Brutus, a youth who exhibited a
      capacious development of the eating and drinking organs, with a winning
      smile that would have made his fortune through a horse-collar, emerged
      from his post of honour behind the puffed sleeves and rustling skirts of
      &ldquo;ma's,&rdquo; and aunt's silk gowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be frightened, Guy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Flumgarten, soothingly; &ldquo;it's <i>only</i>
      Mr. Timwig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I arn't a-going to, aunt,&rdquo; snuffled the self-complaisant Master Guy.

      Master Guy Muff made the effort, Mr. Brutus Muff acting as prompter.

      Muff.

      Master Muff.&mdash;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it something about curls and front?&rdquo; said Mr. Muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Muff took this as an affront to her own particular jazey, which was
      bushily redolent of both; she darted a fierce frown <i>à la</i> Fubsy at
      the interrogator, that awed him to silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Muff.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

      The subdued master-mason felt the full force of this line, to which his
      son Guy's appropriate pronunciation and personal stare gave a <i>new
      reading</i>. Here the juvenile spouter broke down, upon which Mrs.
      Flumgarten took his voice under her patronage, and having prevailed on him
      to try a song, the &ldquo;young idea&rdquo; began in an excruciating wheeze, as if a
      pair of bellows had been invited to sing, the following <i>morceau</i>.
      &ldquo;More so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Muff, encouragingly, &ldquo;because pa said it was almost
      good enough to be sung a Sundays after <i>Tabernacle</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There was a little bird,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      His cage hung in the hall;

    <p class="indent15">
      On Monday morning, May the third,

      He couldn't sing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And for this reason, mark,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Good people, great and small,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Because the pussey, for a lark,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Had eat him, bones and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Aunt F. approvingly, &ldquo;that is a song! None of your frothy
      comic stuff that <i>some folks</i> (!!) is so fond of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She now entertained Uncle Timothy with an account, full of bombast and
      brag, of some grand weddings that had recently been celebrated in the
      Fubsy family,&mdash;the <i>Candlerigs</i> having condescended to
      adulterate the patrician blood of St. Giles's in-the-Fields with the
      plebeian puddle of the City Gardens, the sometime suburban retreat of the
      Fubsys, where they farmed a magnificent chateau, which, like the great
      Westphalian Baron de Thunder-tan-trounck's, had a door and a window. Uncle
      Timothy, to change the subject, called on Mr. Brutus Muff for a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heered Mr. Muff sing, Mr. Timwig,&rdquo; chimed the sisters
      simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Then, ladies, it will be the greater novelty. Come, my good sir;
      but first a glass of wine with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Timwiddy, you will make Mr. Muff quite top-heavy! It must only be
      a half a glass,&rdquo; said Mrs. Muff, authoritatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The top half, if you please, madam,&rdquo; said the middle-aged gentleman; and
      he poured out the &ldquo;regal purple stream&rdquo; till it kissed, without flowing
      over, the brim. Mr. Muff brought the bumper to a level with his lips, and,
      as if half ashamed of what he was doing, put both halves out of sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the man mad?&rdquo; cried the amazed Mrs. Muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he lost his senses?&rdquo; ejaculated the bewildered Mrs. Flumgarten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has found them, rather,&rdquo; whispered the satirical-nosed gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bland looks and persuasive tones of Uncle Timothy, to say nothing of
      the last bumper, had wrought wonders on the master-mason. He looked
      Silenus-like and rosy, and glanced his little peering eyes across the
      table&mdash;Mrs. Muff having a voice too in the affair&mdash;for an
      assenting nod from the fierce black velvet turban of his better and bigger
      half. But Mrs. Muff made no sign, and he paused irresolute; when another
      kind word from the middle-aged gentleman encouraged him, at all hazards,
      to begin with,

      &ldquo;You shan't sing another line, that you shan't, Brutus!&rdquo; vociferated Mrs.
      Muff. But the Cockney Roman, undaunted and vocal, went on singing,

      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Says Doctor Peter Pott, &ldquo;As I know vhat's vhat,

      &ldquo;Where could he have learned such a rubbishing song? A man, too, after

      &ldquo;Have you no compassion for my poor nerves?&rdquo; remonstrated Mrs. Muff,
      pathetically.

      &ldquo;None vhatsumdever,&rdquo; replied the stoical Brutus. &ldquo;Vhat compassion have you

      &ldquo;I'll send,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Flumgarten, furiously, &ldquo;for one of the L

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may send to Old Nick for one of the L division!&rdquo; shouted the valiant

      &ldquo;Here I lays, Teddy O'Blaize, (Singing)

    <p>
      And now, my invaluable spouse, as I carn't conwenienly sing you any more
      moral lessons, I'll tipple you two or three!&rdquo; And Mr. Muff, with admirable
      coolness and precision, filled himself a bumper. &ldquo;First and foremust, from
      this day henceforrer'd, I'm determined to be my own lord and master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imprimis and secondly, I don't choose to be the hen-pecked, colly

      loving Lizzy, currycomb my precious vig, and smuggle my last vill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Et tu Brute!</i>&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy, in a half whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a brute!&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Flumgarten, &ldquo;to speak so of poor dear pa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't <i>purwoke</i> me, Mrs. Flumgarten, into 'fending and proving, or I
      shall let the cat out of the bag, and the kittens into the bargain! By the
      Lord Harry, I'll <i>peach</i>, Mrs. Muff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Flumgarten's unruly member was about to pour upon the master-mason a
      flood of Fubsyean eloquence, when <i>Prudence</i>, the family guardian
      angel, took her by the tongue's tip, as St. Dunstan took a certain ebony
      gentleman by the nose. She telegraphed Mrs. Muff, and Mrs. Muff
      telegraphed the intelligent Guy. Just as Brutus was fetching breath for
      another ebullition, with his hand on the decanter for another bumper, he
      found himself half throttled in the Cornish hug of his affectionate and
      blubbering first-born! When a chimney caught fire, it was a custom in
      Merrie England to drop down it a live goose, in the quality of
      extinguisher! And no goose ever performed its office better than the
      living Guy. He opened the flood-gates of his gooseberry eyes, and played
      upon pa so effectually, that Mr. Muff's ire or fire was speedily put out;
      and when, to prevent a coroner's inquest, the obedient child was motioned
      by the ladies to relax his filial embrace, the mollified master-mason
      began to sigh and sob too. The politic sisters now proposed to cut short
      their day's pleasure!&mdash;Uncle Timothy, to whom it was some
      consolation, that while he had been sitting upon thorns, his tormentors
      too were a little nettled, seeing bluff John Tomkins in the stable-yard
      grooming <i>con amore</i> one of Mr. Bosky's pet bloods, called out,
      &ldquo;John! Tm afraid we were too many this morning for that shying
      left-wheeler. Now, if he should take to kicking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kicking! Mr. Timwiddy!&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Flumgarten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kicking! Mr. Timwig!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herodotus (who practised what he preached) said, &ldquo;When telling a lie will
      be profitable, let it be told!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He may lie,&rdquo; said Plato, &ldquo;who knows
      <i>how</i> to do it in a suitable time.&rdquo; So thought John Tomkins! who
      hoping to frighten his unwelcome customers into an omnibus, and drive home
      Uncle Timothy in capital style, so aggravated the possible kickings,
      plungings, takings fright, and runnings away of that terrible
      left-wheeler, that the accommodating middle-aged gentleman was easily
      persuaded by the ladies to lighten the weight and diminish the danger, by
      returning to town by some other conveyance. And it was highly entertaining
      to mark the glum looks of John when he doggedly put the horses to, and how
      he mischievously laid his whipcord into the sensitive flanks of the
      &ldquo;shying left-wheeler,&rdquo; that honoured every draft on his fetlocks, and
      confirmed the terrifying anticipations and multiplications of the
      veracious John Tomkins!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Song sweetens toil, however rude the sound,&rdquo;&mdash;and John sweetened his
      by humming the following, in which he encored himself several times, as he
      drove Mrs. Flumgarten and family, to town.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>ive me a woman as
      old as Hecuba, or as ugly as Caifacaratadaddera, rather than Mrs.
      Flumgarten! Were the annoyance confined to <i>herself</i>, I should cry,
      'Content,'&mdash;for she who sows nettles and thorns is entitled to reap a
      stinging and prickly harvest. Ill temper should ride quarantine, and have
      a <i>billet de santé</i>, before it is let loose upon society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were among the ruminations of Uncle Timothy as he sauntered homeward
      through the green fields. Two interesting objects lay before him: the
      village church and grave-yard, and a row of ancient almshouses, the pious
      endowment of a bountiful widow, who having been brought to feel what
      sorrow was, had erected them, as the last resting-place but <i>one</i>,
      for the aged and the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There dwelt in our ancestors * a fine spirit of humanity towards the
      helpless and the needy. The charitable pittance was not doled out to them
      by the hand of insolent authority; but the wayfarer, heart-weary, and
      foot-sore, claimed at the gates of these pious institutions ** (a few of
      which still remain in their primitive simplicity) his loaf, his lodging,
      and his groat, which were dispensed, generally with kindness, and always
      with decency. Truly we may say, that what the present generation has
      gained in <i>head</i> (and even this admission is subject to many
      qualifications), it has lost in <i>heart!!</i>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  &ldquo;Before the Reformation, there were no Poor's Rates. The
     charitable dole, given at the religious houses, and the
     church-ale in every parish, did the business.

     &ldquo;In every parish there was a Church-house, to which belonged
     spits, pots, &amp;c. for dressing provision. Here the
     housekeepers met, and were merry, and gave their charity.
     The young people came there too, and had dancing, bowling,
     shooting at butts, &amp;c. Mr. A. Wood assures me, that there
     were few or no almshouses before the time of Henry the
     Eighth; that at Oxon, opposite Christchurch, was one of the
     most ancient in England.&rdquo;&mdash;Aubrey MSS.

     ** Was it ever intended&mdash;is it just&mdash;is it fitting, that the
     Masterships of St. Cross at Winchester, and St. Katharine's,
     London, should be such sumptuous sinecures?
</pre>
    <p>
      A grave had just received its &ldquo;poor inhabitant the mourners had departed,
      and two or three busy urchins, with shovels and spades, were filling in
      the earth; while the sexton, a living clod, nothing loth to see his work
      done by proxy, looked, with open mouth and leaden eyes, carelessly on.
      Uncle Timothy walked slowly up the path, and pausing before the &ldquo;narrow
      cell,&rdquo; enforced silence and decency by that irresistible charm that ever
      accompanied his presence. His pensive, thoughtful look, almost surprised
      the gazers into sympathy. Who was the silent tenant? None could tell. He
      was a stranger in the village; but their pastor must have known something
      of his story; for his voice faltered whilst reading the funeral service,
      and he was observed to weep. Uncle Timothy passed on, and continued his
      peregrination among the tombs. How grossly had the dead been libelled by
      the flattery of the living! Here was &ldquo;a tender husband, a loving father,
      and an honest man,&rdquo; who certainly had never tumbled his wife out at
      window, kicked his children out of doors, or picked his neighbour's pocket
      in broad daylight on the King's highway; yet was he a hypocritical
      heartless old money-worshipper! There lay a &ldquo;disconsolate widow,&rdquo; the
      names of whose three &ldquo;lamented husbands&rdquo; were chiselled on her tombstone!
      To the more opulent of human clay, who could afford plenty of lead and
      stone,&mdash;perchance the emblems of their dull, cold heads and hearts,&mdash;what
      pompous quarries were raised above ground! what fulsome inscriptions
      dedicated! But the poor came meanly off. Here and there a simple flower,
      blooming on the raised sod, and fondly cherished, told of departed friends
      and kindred not yet forgotten! And who that should see a rose thus
      affectionately planted would let it droop and wither for want of a tear?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought Uncle Timothy, &ldquo;may I make my last bed with the poor!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Let not unkind, untimely thrift
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      These little boons deny;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Nor those who love me while I live
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A monument of chaste and simple design attracted his attention. It was to
      the memory of a gentle spirit, whom he mourned with a brother's love. Four
      lines were all that had been thought essential to say; but they were
      sufficiently expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Father! thy name we bless,

    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Giver of every good and perfect gift&rdquo; had taken her daughter before
      she knew sin or sorrow. Her epitaph ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Oh! happy they who call'd to rest
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Ere sorrow fades their bloom,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Awhile a blessing are&mdash;and bless'd&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    <p>
      A. deep and holy calm fell upon Uncle Timothy, with a sweet assurance that
      a happier meeting with departed friends was not far distant. And as the
      guardianship of ministering angels was his firm belief and favourite
      theme, his secret prayer at this solemn moment was, that they might save
      him from the bodily and mental infirmities, the selfishness and apathy of
      protracted years. He read the inscriptions over again, with a full
      conviction of their truthfulness. <i>They were his own.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      At an obscure corner&mdash;and afar off&mdash;<i>Truth</i>, for a wonder,
      had written an epitaph upon one who loved, not his <i>species</i>, but his
      <i>specie!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Beneath this stone old Nicholas lies;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Nobody laughs, and nobody cries.

      And at no great distance was a tomb entirely overgrown with rank weeds,
      nettles, and thorns; and there was a superstitious legend attached to it,
      that they all grew up in one night, and though they had been several times
      rooted up, still, in one night, they all grew up again! Stones had been
      ignominiously cast upon it; and certain ancient folks of the village
      gravely affirmed that, on the anniversary of the burial of the miserable
      crone, the <i>Black Sanctus</i> * was performed by herself and guardian
      spirits!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Isaac Reed informs us (see note upon Chapman's Widow's
     Tears, in Dodsley's Old Plays) that &ldquo;the <i>Black Sanctus</i> was
     a hymn to Saint Satan, written in ridicule of Monkish
     luxury.&rdquo; And Tarlton (see News out of Purgatory) quotes it
     in &ldquo;the Tale of Pope Boniface.&rdquo;

     &ldquo;And' upon this there was a general mourning through all
     Rome: the cardinals wept, the abbots howled, the monks
     rored, the fryers cried, the nuns puled, the curtezans
     lamented, the bels rang, the tapers were lighted, that such
     a Blacke Sanctus was not seene a long time afore in Rome.&rdquo;,

     The Black Sanctus here said to be performed was of a
     different kind. It was assuredly &ldquo;a hymn to Satan,&rdquo; in which
     the crone and the most favoured of her kindred took the
     base; Hypocrisy leading the band, and Avarice scraping the
     fiddle.

     &ldquo;The rest God knows&mdash;perhaps the Devil&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A yew-tree stretched forth its bare branches over the tomb, which in one
      night also became withered and blasted!

    </h5>
    <p>
      At the porch of the entre almshouse sat an aged female in awidows garb,
      and beside her the village pastor. From the earnestness of his address, he
      seemed to be exhorting her to resignation; but the tears that fell from
      her eyes proved how hard was the task! Though Uncle Timothy would not have
      done homage to the highest potentate in Christendom for all the wealth and
      distinction that he or she could bestow, he felt his knees tremble under
      him at the sacredness of humble sorrow. He walked up the neat little
      flower garden, and having read the grateful memorial inscribed over the
      ancient doorway to the charitable foundress, was about to speak, when the
      words, &ldquo;<i>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted</i>,&rdquo;
       fell like the dews of heaven upon his ear! The widow looked up&mdash;she
      hushed every sigh&mdash;she wiped away every tear&mdash;the divine potency
      of the promise sustained her, and she wept no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little ceremony did Uncle Timothy use towards the good pastor and his
      comforted mourner. His address began with a simple question, who was the
      brother that he had so recently consigned to the grave?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This poor widow's only son! The story, sir, is brief and mournful.
      Bankruptcy and ruin hurried her husband to the grave. This asylum opened
      its door to receive her; and here, though reviewing the past with fond
      regret, she became grateful for the present, and hopeful for the future.
      Her son, a youth of fine intellect, submitted to the ill-paid drudgery of
      an office where the hands, not the head, were required; and he delighted
      to spare from his narrow pittance such additional comforts for his mother
      as were not contemplated by the pious foundress in those primitive times.
      He would hasten hither on beautiful summer evenings after the business of
      the day, to trim her little garden, surprise her with some frugal luxury,
      and see that she was happy. The Sabbath he never omitted passing under
      this roof, and he led her to my pew,&mdash;for she is a gentlewoman, sir,&mdash;where
      she sat with my family. Consumption seized his frame; and what privations
      did he endure, what fatigues did he brave, to conceal the first fatal
      symptoms from his mother! Of a melancholy temperament, endued with all the
      fine sensibilities of genius, death, under much less unprosperous
      circumstances, would have been a welcome visitor; but to die&mdash;and
      leave&mdash;no matter. I promised to take upon myself the solemn charge,
      should the dreaded moment arrive. It has arrived, and that promise, by the
      blessing of my God, I will faithfully redeem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Timothy was not an envious man&mdash;he knew envy by name only. But
      if at this particular moment his heart could have been anatomised, O, how
      he envied the good pastor!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The disease gained ground with fearful strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to absent himself from business; and as his employers were
      no-work-no-pay philanthropists, he was left to his own slender resources,
      and retired here to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sustained my lost son in his long sickness, comforted him, and
      received his last sigh? Ah! sir&mdash;But I dare not disobey your too
      strict injunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Friend of the poor! the mourner feels thy aid&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She cannot pay thee, but thou wilt be paid!'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not many evenings since that I accompanied my dear young friend in
      one of his solitary rambles. The sun was setting in golden splendour, and
      tinged the deep blue clouds that appeared like mountains rising above one
      another. 'Yon glorious orb,' he cried, with sacred fervour, 'emblem of
      immortality!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The setting and the rising sun
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To me are themes of deep reflection&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Death, frail mortal! is the one,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The other is thy resurrection.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Oh! be that resurrection mine,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And glorious as those rays divine!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after I was called to his bed-side; the hand of death had
      seized him; he recognised me, smiled, and gently pressed my hand. '<i>Every
      misery missed</i>,' he whispered, '<i>is a mercy!</i>' A faint struggle,
      and a short sigh succeeded, and he was gone to his rest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a poor figure would this simple record of good works, lively faith,
      and filial piety make in a modern obituary, where incoherent ravings are
      eagerly noted down by officious death-bed gossipers, and wrought into a
      romance, always egotistical, and too often profane! To you, madam,&rdquo; added
      Uncle Timothy, &ldquo;consolation and hope have been brought by a
      heaven-appointed messenger. Something, however, remains to be done in a
      worldly sense. But I see our friend is on the eve of departure; what I was
      about to propose shall be submitted to him when we are alone. In the mean
      time, you will please to consider this humble roof but as a temporary
      home. It abounds in sad remembrances, which change of scene may soften
      down, if not entirely dispel. I have a dear, affectionate relative, who
      would deeply regard you, were it only for your sorrow. And as there 'is a
      special providence in the falling of a sparrow,' I cannot doubt that some
      good spirit directed me hither. God bless you! We shall very soon meet
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And locking the kind pastor's arm in his own, he hurried down the little
      garden, pausing for a moment to gather a pale rose, which he placed in his
      bosom.

      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>ailly, Master
      Jackimo, I'm quite ashamed on your laziness! you only gits up to lie down,
      and only lies down to git up! and, instead of making your bow to the
      ladies and gentlemen, and holding out your cap to catch the coppers, you
      are everlastingly a-doing o' nuffin but pulling up your shirt-collar, and
      cracking o' nuts. Havn't I treated you more like a relation than a monkey&mdash;giving
      you the best of advice? But if ever I find you at your old fun ag'in, as
      sure as my name's Blinking Billy, <i>I'll take off your goold scarlet
      waistcoat!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was addressed by an itinerant musician, in a shocking bad hat, with a
      garnish of old red cotton nightcaps, to his mendicant monkey, that he had
      perched upon <i>Whittington's Stone</i> for the purpose of taking him more
      conveniently to task.
    </p>
    <p>
      The offender was of a grave aspect, with a remarkably knowing look. He was
      dressed <i>en militaire</i>, with an old-fashioned scarlet waistcoat
      embroidered with tinsel, of which he seemed monstrously vain. He listened
      with becoming seriousness to the musician's expostulation, slyly reserving
      in the corner of his jaw a nut that he deferred to crack till opportunity
      should offer. But at the threat of losing his <i>red waistcoat</i>, he
      gibbered, chattered, and by every species of pantomimical begging and
      bowing, promised future amendment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had not the mind of Uncle Timothy been too much occupied with recent
      events, he would have scraped acquaintance with monkey and man, who were
      evidently eccentrics, and Uncle Tim was a lover of eccentricity. The
      moment that the monkey spied a customer, he began his work of reformation,
      by jumping off the stone, running the full tether of his chain, making a
      graceful bow, and holding out his cap for a contribution. His politeness
      was rewarded with sixpence from Uncle Timothy, and an approving word from
      his master; and the middle-aged gentleman, serenaded by a passing grind
      from the barrel-organ, walked slowly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A caravansary of exhibitors bound to Bartholomew Fair had halted at Mother
      Red Cap's, * an ancient hostelrie at the foot of Highgate Hill. Although
      weary and parched with thirst, Uncle Timothy might probably have journeyed
      onward, had not the &ldquo;beck'ning ghost&rdquo; of jovial John.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mother Red Cap, doubtless an emanation from Elinour
     Rumming, was a favourite sign during the sixteenth and
     seventeenth centuries, and the black Jack that she held in
     her hand was a symbol of good ale. Two ancient hostelries
     still bear her prepossessing effigy: one in the Hampstead
     Road, near Kentish Town; and one at Holloway. It is said
     that a remarkable shrew, Mother Damnable, of Kentish town,
     (of whom the late Mr. Bindley had an unique engraving,) gave
     rise to the former sign. This ill-favoured lady looks more
     like a witch than an ale-wife. She would have frightened her
     customers out of the house, and their horses out of the
     stable! We are inclined to give the palm of priority to the
     venerable red-capped mother at Holloway, who must have been
     moderately notorious in the time of Drunken Barnaby, when he
     halted to regale himself at her portal.

          &ldquo;Thence to Holloway, Mother Red-cap
          In a troop of trulls I did hap;
          Wh&mdash;s of Babylon me impalled,
          And me their Adonis called;
          With me toy'd they, buss'd me, cull'd me,
          But being needy, out they pulled me.&rdquo;

      Backster, * flitting in the evening grey, motioned him, in imagination, to
      enter.

      He made his way to the low-roofed side parlour, where were assembled a
      troop of showmen and conjurors. One fellow was busily employed in shaving
      a baboon, ** which he intended to exhibit as a fairy; and another was
      rasping the rough chin of a muzzled bear, that bore the operation with
      exemplary patience, sitting in an arm-chair, dressed in a check waiscoat
      and trowsers, in his professional character of an Ethiopian savage!

     * John Backster kept the Mother Red Cap at Holloway in 1667.
     We are in possession of his very curious and rare Token, on
     the right side of which is engraved Mother Red Cap holding a
     Black Jack, with his initials of &ldquo;J. B. His Half Peny:* and
     on the reverse, &ldquo;John Backster, att-the Mother Read-Capp in
     hollway, 1667.&rdquo;

     ** The baboon and the monkey were popular drolls in ancient
     times. The following lines occur in a work called &ldquo;Ayres or
     Phantasticke Sprites for three Voices,&rdquo; published by Thomas
     Weelkes, &ldquo;Batchelar of Musicke,&rdquo; 1608.

          &ldquo;The ape, the monkey, and baboon did meet,
          And breaking of their fast in Friday Street;
          Two of them sware together solemnly
          In their three natures was a sympathy.
          'Nay,' quoth Baboon, 'I do deny that strain,
          I have more knavery in me than you twain.'
          &ldquo;'Why,' quoth the Ape,
          'I have a horse at will
          In Paris Garden, for to ride on still,
          And there show trieks.'&mdash;
          'Tush,' quoth the Monkey,
          'I For better trieks in great men's houses lie.'
          'Tush!' quoth Baboon; 'when men do know I come,
          For sport from town and country they will run.'&rdquo;

      A conjuror was looking at a large dragon-fly through a magnifying glass,
      to see how it would pass off for the great high German higher-flighter;
      and the proprietor of an aviary was supplying a young blackbird with an
      artificial comb and wattles of red velvet, to find a customer for him as
      the great cocky, or olla bird of the desert. A showman was mending the
      fractured bridge of Mr. Punch's nose, while his stage-manager tried a new
      tail on the devil. *

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In some of the old plays the devil was dressed in a black
     suit, painted with flames, and made to shine. &ldquo;Let the devil
     wear black for me, I'll have a suit of sables,&rdquo; says Hamlet.
     In the mysteries and moralities of an earlier date, he was
     decorated with a hairy dress, like a wild beast.

      The master of the monster tea-kettle, who had recently been &ldquo;up the
      spout,&rdquo; was tricking out his red-haired, strapping Dulcinea with peacocks'
      feathers, bits of stained glass, catskins, strips of coloured leather, and
      teaching her to sing some unintelligible gibberish, for the purpose of
      extracting from the Bartholomew Fair gulls a penny for the prodigious
      sight of a real wild Indian. A mermaid was in process of completion; a dog
      was practising a minuet, to see how his fifth leg fitted him; a learned
      pig * was going through his lesson in numbers and cards; a cat of
      extraordinary intelligence was feeding a kitten with starch, to make it
      stand upright; and a monkey instructing an intellectual goose how to carry
      a pair of miniature milkpails.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The earliest account that we have seen of a learned pig is
     in an old Bartholomew Fair hill, issued by Mr. Conjuror
     Fawkes, which exhibits the portrait of the swinish pundit
     holding a paper in his mouth, with the letter Y inscribed
     upon it. This &ldquo;most amazing pig,&rdquo; which had a particularly
     curly tail, was the pattern of docility and sagacity: the
     &ldquo;Pig of Knowledge, Being the only one ever taught in
     England.&rdquo; He was to be visited &ldquo;at a Commodious Room, at the
     George, West-Smithfield, During the time of the Fair and the
     spectators were required to &ldquo;See and Believe!&rdquo; Three-pence
     was the price of admission to behold &ldquo;This astonishing
     animal&rdquo; perform with cards, money, and watches, &amp;c. &amp;c. The
     bill concludes with the following apotheosis to the pig.

          &ldquo;A learned pig in George's reign,
          To Æsop's brutes an equal boast;
          Then let mankind again combine,
          To render friendship still a toast.&rdquo;

     Stella said that Swift could write sublimely upon a
     broomstick. Who ever, as the Methodists say, better
     &ldquo;improved&rdquo; a pig? Except by roasting it! In 1732, Mr. Fawkes
     exhibited a &ldquo;learned goose&rdquo; opposite the George Inn, West-
     Smithfield.

     was about nine feet nine inches high&mdash;or eleven feet,
     according to some commentators. The Emperor Maximinus is
     said to have been nine feet. Turner, the naturalist,
     mentions having seen on the Brazil coast a race of gigantic
     savages, one of whom measured twelve feet! And Monsieur
     Thevet, in his description of America, published at Paris in
     1575,

     declares that he saw and measured the skeleton of a South
     American, which was eleven feet five inches in length. Die-
     merbroeek saw at Utreeht a well-proportioned living man,
     measuring eight feet six inches; and Dr. Becamus was
     introduced to a youth who was nearly nine feet high; a man
     almost ten feet, and a woman quite ten feet. The Patagonians
     have been represented as a nation of giants. The
     Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society contain
     accounts of skeletons dug up in England, measuring eight and
     nine feet in length, which probably were Roman. In the
     forty-first and forty-second volumes of the same work are
     two engravings taken from an os front is and an os
     bregmatis, the former of which is reckoned to have belonged
     to a person between eleven and twelve feet high; the latter
     to a giant of thirteen feet four inches. Walter Parsons,
     porter to King James the First, was seven feet seven inches
     in stature. The Chinese would have us believe that they
     possess giants fifteen feet high. More of these prodigies

     * The custom of bearing an ape on the shoulder at country
     fairs, &amp;c. is very ancient. Ben Jonson makes the following
     allusion to it in his Masque of Gypsies:

          &ldquo;A gypsy in his shape,
          More calls the beholder,
          Than the fellow with the ape,

      The person of Uncle Timothy was imposing; and the superfine broad cloth
      and brass buttons of Mr. Rumfit had invested it with a magisterial
      character that caused a sudden movement among the exhibitors when he
      entered their sanctorum. But the middle-aged gentleman soon convinced them
      that he was a man of humanity, and no magistrate; which quieted the alarms
      of both men and monkeys; and so gracious were his looks and demeanour,
      that the shaved bear, which had viewed him with scowling distrust, no
      longer kept aloof, but proffered his shaggy paw for a shake. At this
      moment the lecturing musician entered the room, and Jackimo, recognising
      his benefactor, jumped from the organ, ran up to him, doffed his cap, and
      made his best bow! Uncle Timothy and his company being now upon terms, he
      ordered in biscuits for the monkeys, and buns for the bears; not
      forgetting some nuts for his friend, who waited for the musician's nod
      before he cracked one of them. He then inquired of the bear-ward what his
      four-footed companion would like to drink? Upon which the keeper consulted
      his oracle, and received for reply, that a jug of homebrewed, with a toast
      and sugar, would be supremely acceptable! Uncle Timothy started,
      conceiving Bruin to have suddenly become possessed of Balaam's miraculous
      quality: but the mystery was soon explained; the keeper being a
      ventriloquist, and this one of his Bartlemy Fair tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray gentlemen,&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy, &ldquo;by what means do you make these
      animals so apprehensive and docile? I fear there is some cruelty in the
      case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No cruelty at all, good sir,&rdquo; replied the lecturing musician, who was the
      organ of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your Smithfield drovers and butchers as is cruel! We don't larn our
      hanimals to dance on red-hot iron plates, as our aunt's sisters
      (ancestors?) did. Now that 'ere monkey o' mine; never was sich a wain
      little cove! It costes me a fortin in starch to stiffen his shirt collars;
      and if any on'em is in the least limp, my wig! he chatters, grins, and
      gies himself all the airs and graces of a fine lady. Sometimes I larn him
      his dooty by long lessons and short commons; sometimes I threatens&mdash;only
      threatens!&mdash;(but that in your honour's ear, for he's a-listening all
      the while!) to tip him monkey's allowance (shaking ferociously a very thin
      cane); but when I want to touch his feelings, I says, 'Jackimo, you're a
      good-for-nuffin little monster, and I'll walk off your <i>red waistcoat!</i>'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the monkey and the bear, how relish they the razor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly, sir, kindly!&rdquo; replied the Bruin shaver. &ldquo;At first my old feller
      was summut rough and ugly; his beard turned the hedges of three
      oyster-knives afore I could trim him into a gentleman. But now he sees the
      advantage on it. <i>Don't you, my daisy?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bear, after the fashion of the Irish echo, was made to ventriloquise
      in a growl, gruffly, &ldquo;<i>I does, my tulip!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The several rehearsals being over, and all things put in order for their
      approaching campaign, the exhibitors were about to depart, when it
      occurred to Uncle Timothy that he had not paid his footing for being
      admitted behind the scenes. He addressed the real wild Indian, and begged
      her to call for what best pleased her palate; which call resolved itself
      into a rasher on the coals, a rummer of nutbrown, and a thimblefull of
      brandy to keep off the spasms. She was then escorted to her tea-kettle,
      and put under cover for the night. The bear and the monkey having been
      similarly disposed of, their respective shavers made merry with the rest
      of the show-folk. Uncle Timothy took the little Italian boys under his
      care, and feasted them plenteously. At this moment a <i>rival</i>
      tea-kettle drew up, with a caravan in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, madam,&rdquo; said a tragedy queen, peeping through a bit of ragged green
      curtain that depended before the entrance to the tea-kettle, to a dwarf in
      the caravan, &ldquo;do you put up at Mother Red Cap's?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This old house, fronting the fields at Hoxton, was
     formerly a noted place of resort for the Finsbury archers.
     Sir William D'Avenant, in his &ldquo;Long Vacation in London,&rdquo;
      says of the proctors and attorneys,

          &ldquo;Each with solemn oath agree
          To meet in Fields of Finsburie;
          With loynes in canvas bow-case tyde,
          Where arrowes stick with mickle pride;
          With hats pinn'd up, and bow in hand,
          All day most fiercely there they stand,
          Like ghosts of Adam Bell and Clymme,
          Sol sets for fear they'll shoot at him.&rdquo;

     A stray Toxopholite may now and then be seen at the Robin
     Hood, stringing his bow, and dreaming of the 'merry days
     that are past. Underneath the ancient sign is the following
     inscription.

          &ldquo;Ye archers bold, and yeomen good,
          Stop, and drink with Robin Hood;
          If Robin Hood is not at home,
          Stop, and drink with Little John.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, madam,&rdquo; responded the Lilliputian lady; &ldquo;I stops at the Robin Hood
      * at merry Hoxton; * none but the <i>lower orders</i> stops at Mother Red

      The rival tea-kettle poured out part of its contents in the person of a
      long, lean man, with all his limbs rambling; no way reduceable to compass,
      unless you doubled him up like a pocket-rule. His wardrobe was
      illustrative of Jew frippery and Rag-Fair tawdry. He was tricked out in
      the relics of a ci-devant shirt; his coat was a patchwork quilt, his
      waistcoat and pantaloons were the sign of the chequers, an escutcheon

      Bigstick, let it be buttered on <i>both</i> sides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This dialogue was carried on between the long lean man and an invisible
      sharp-voiced personage in the tea-kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee and toast for the tea-kettle,&rdquo; shouted the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many?&rdquo; demanded mine host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four. Lady Teaser, Belvideary, Miss Cannister, and Mrs. Longbow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mort de ma vie!</i>&rdquo; ejaculated the long lean man. &ldquo;For one!&mdash;In
      the Tumbletuzzy all these characters are combined. And, <i>garçon</i>,
      bring me a basin of tea and a&mdash;biscuit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The frugal refection was laid before the lean man. &ldquo;Cat-lap base!&rdquo; he
      muttered, swallowing the scalding hot bohea, that was strongly impregnated
      with Sir Hugh Middleton, and champing the dry biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another round of toast for Lady Teaser!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buttered on <i>both</i> sides,&rdquo; growled the lean man, sarcastically; and
      he began to number with his skinny fingers, as if counting the cost.

      Uncle Timothy was the last person in the world to flout a threadbare coat,
      because it is threadbare, or take a man for a sharper because he happens
      to be sharp-witted or sharp-set. Your full-fed fool he thought quite as
      likely to have nefarious designs on his purse, as the hungry humorist who
      at once lets you into the secret of his starvation. If he be deserving as
      well as poor, it was gratifying to Uncle Tim that he had made honest
      poverty forget its privations for a season; and should he prove a shirking
      idler on the <i>pavé</i>&mdash;, he had not been taken in at any vast
      expense. Reflections like these crossed his mind&mdash;and he left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return, he found the lean man still counting with his fingers.
      Presently the waiter spread the table with a snow-white cloth; the
      clattering of knives and forks, plates and spoons, roused the lean man
      from his reverie; he gazed wistfully at the preparations, and looked
      thrice famished.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a story of a tyrant, who, to add to the natural torments of
      starvation, caused a roast chicken to be suspended every day before the
      prison bars of his victim, until he expired. Just such a tormentor,
      unwittingly, was Uncle Timothy. For the <i>garçon</i> again appeared,
      bearing a dish of broiled ham and poached eggs, the sight and aroma of
      which seared the eye-balls and tantalised the pinched nostrils of the lean
      man. At the same moment, &ldquo;Another round for Lady Teaser!&rdquo; tolled a
      twopenny knell in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend not arrived yet?&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the <i>garçon</i> slyly, but respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him pay, then, for his want of punctuality. I wait for nobody. Will
      <i>you</i>, sir,&rdquo; politely addressing the lean man, &ldquo;do me the favour to
      be my guest? Though I have ordered supper for two, I cannot command
      appetite for two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lean man stared irresolutely at Uncle Timothy. Hunger and Pride were
      at fisticuffs; but Hunger hit pride such a blow in the stomach, that Pride
      gave up the contest.

      And how gracefully did the middle-aged gentleman play the host! inviting
      his guest (though little invitation was needed) with the kindest words,
      and helping him to the daintiest morsels. And it was not until this
      supper-out of the first lustre had fully indulged his eating propensities,
      and cleared the board, that he found leisure to look up from his plate,
      and contemplate the execution he had done. But when a cauliflower-wigged
      tankard of stout crowned the repast, he pressed it with ecstasy to his
      lips, and sang joyously&mdash;

     * About the year 1775, there was a performer on the violin-
     cello in the orchestra of Drury Lane Theatre, named
     Cervetti, to whom the gods had given the appropriate
     nickname of Nosey, from his enormous staysail, that helped
     to carry him before the wind. &ldquo;Nosey!&rdquo; shouted from the
     galleries, was the signal, or word of command for the
     fiddlers to strike up. This man was originally an Italian
     merchant of good repute; but failing in business, he came
     over to England, and adopted music for a profession. He had
     a notable knack of loud yawning, with which he sometimes
     unluckily filled up Garrick's expressive pauses, to the
     infinite annoyance of little Davy, and the laughter of the
     audience. In the summer of 1777 he played at Vauxhall, at
     the age of ninety-eight.

     The Lauréat of Little Britain must have had just such
     another Nose in his eye when he wrote the following.

          That Roman Nose! that Roman Nose!
          Has robb'd my bosom of repose;
          For when in sleep my eyelids close,
          It haunts me still, that Roman Nose!
          Between two eyes as black as sloes
          The bright and flaming ruby glows;
          That Roman Nose! that Roman Nose!
          And beats the blush of damask rose.
          I walk the streets, the alleys, rows;
          I look at all the Jems and Joes;
          And old and young, and friends and foes,
          But cannot find a Roman Nose!
          Then blessed be the day I chose
          That nasal beauty of my beau's;
          And when at last to heaven I goes,
          I hope to spy his Roman Nose!

     * &ldquo;Islington, March 2O, 1698. This day here were lamentable
     doings. O! in what a sad fright and consternation were the
     Lick-spickets of this plaee; upon the suddain and unexpected
     appearance of the ferreters of Fuddling-schools all were put
     into a hurry and confusion, the men were forced to throw
     down their beloved pipes of sotweed, and rudely leave their
     pots without a parting kiss; the women and children too,
     alas! with tears and sighs, parted with their hot cakes and
     custards, before they had half stuffed their stomachs. And
     the streets were filled with the mourning mob. Amongst the
     rest was a fat red-faced hostess, who, with a loud and
     doleful voice, said, 4 Ah! my friends, if this business
     holds, I shall certainly be undone. Ah! poor Islington, thou
     hast been, time out of mind, the plaee of general rendezvous
     for Sunday sots. Thou hast constantly supplied the citizens'
     wives and children with cakes, pies, and custards, and art
     the chief plaee near the city, for breeding calves and
     nursing children. Thou, I say, that hast been a place so
     famous, and in such esteem, now to have the richest of thy
     inhabitants utterly ruined only for profaning the Sabbath-
     day. Alas! the only day we have to get money in. Who will
     advise me?'&mdash;'Advise you,' said one of her sottish
     customers, 'you have kept an ale-house almost thirty years,
     to my knowledge, and if you have not got enough by nicking,
     frothing, double-scoreing, selling coarse cakes, empty pies,
     and nasty custards, to keep you now you are old, e'en go to
     your old master, the devil, and let him keep you!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
     English Lueian, or Weekly Discoveries of the Witty
     Intrigues, Comical Passages, and Remarkable Transactions in
     Town and Country, &amp;c. &amp;c.&rdquo;

     The above is a curious picture of an Islington ale-wife in
     the olden time. The following account describes a &ldquo;strange
     monster&rdquo; exhibited at Miles's Music-house at Islington a few
     years after, with the comical interlude of the Stuffed
     Alligator.

     &ldquo;Some time since there was brought to Miles's Music-house at
     Islington, a strange sort of a monster, that does everything
     like a monkey, but is not a monkey; mimics man, like a
     jackanapes, but is not a jackanapes; jumps upon tables, and
     into windows upon all-fours, like a cat, but is not a cat;
     does all things like a beast, but is not a beast; does
     nothing like a man, but is a man! He has given such
     wonderful content to the Butchers of Clare Market, that the
     house is every day as full as the Bear Gardens; and draws
     the city wives and prentices out of London, much more than a
     man hanged in chains. It happened lately upon a holiday,
     when honest men walked abroad with their wives and
     daughters, to the great consumption of hot buns and bottled
     ale, that the fame of this mimick had drawn into the Music-
     house as great a crowd of spectators as the notable
     performances of Clinch of Barnet ever drew to the theatre.
     The Frape being thus assembled in the lower room, and the
     better sort being climbed into the gallery, a little
     creature, who before walked erect, and bore the image of a
     man, transformed himself into a monkey, and began to
     entertain the company with such a parcel of pretty pug's
     tricks, and mimical actions, that they were all as intent
     upon the baboon's vagaries as if a mandrake had been
     tumbling through a hoop, or a hobgoblin dancing an antick!
     Whilst the eyes and ears of the assembly were thus deeply
     engaged, the skin of a large alligator, stuff'd with hay,
     hanging within the top of the house, and the rats having
     burrowed through the ceiling, could come down at pleasure
     and sport upon the back of the monster; one of the
     revengeful vermin, to put a trick upon his fellows, who were
     enticed by the smell of the hay to creep down the serpent's
     throat, his jaws being extended, gnawed the cord in two, and
     down comes the alligator with his belly full of rats, upon
     the head of the monkey, and laid him sprawling; giving some
     of the spectators a wipe with his tail; the rats running out
     of his mouth in a wonderful hurry, like so many sailors from
     between decks when a ship at midnight has struck upon a
     rock!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A Pacquet from Will's, 1701.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>ncle Timothy was
      an excursive talker and walker. He had no set phrases; nothing ready-cut
      and dried (which is often <i>very dry</i>) for formal intellectual
      displays. When he rose in the morning, unless bound by some engagement, he
      hardly knew whither his footsteps would tend. He was to be seen looking
      into curiosity shops; rummaging old book-stalls; turning over portfolios
      of curious prints; stepping into an auction, a panorama, an exhibition of
      ancient pictures; sometimes rambling in the green fields, and not
      unfrequently making one of Punch's laughing audiences. It is the opinion
      of some would-be philosophers that their dignity is best upheld by an
      unbending austerity, and a supercilious contempt for whatever engaged the
      attention of their youth. But we tell such pretenders, that they are alike
      ignorant of nature and philosophy. Men of the most exalted genius have
      been <i>remarkable</i> for their urbanity, and even child-like simplicity
      of manners: and it was one of the many interesting traits in the author of
      <i>Waverley</i>, that, in the &ldquo;sear and yellow leaf,&rdquo; he had nothing of
      age but the name; but retained all the spirit, the romance, the gaiety of
      his youthful days.

    <p class="indent15">

    <p>
      Though the world's pursuits brought more care to the heart and profit to
      the purse than his own, he wished they might only prove as innocent and as
      honest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Timothy had just got scent of an ancient carved figure of Falstaff,
      that once adorned the overhanging doorway of the Boar's Head, in
      East-cheap; not the original scene of revelry where Prince Hal and Sir
      John turned night into day. That merry hostelrie, where &ldquo;lean Jack&rdquo; slept
      on benches in the afternoon, and unbuttoned himself after supper, had been
      replaced by another, bearing the same immortal sign, which rose on its
      ruins immediately after the fire of London. The Boar's Head (which we well
      remember) was cut in stone, and let into the brick work under the centre
      window of the first floor. This house had been recently pulled down, in
      order to make room for the new London Bridge improvements; but Uncle
      Timothy heard that the figure had been carefully reserved by the
      proprietor, as a memorial of so celebrated a site. Thither he journeyed on
      a voyage of discovery. The owner of the Boar's Head had departed this
      life; but the neighbours referred him to a nephew, dwelling in an
      adjoining street, who had succeeded the old gentleman in business. The
      worthy tradesman received him with courtesy, and proceeded to narrate what
      had transpired since the demolition of the tavern. The story of the figure
      was strictly true. His late uncle regarded it as an interesting relic, and
      his widow, smitten with a kindred feeling, had retired into the country,
      carrying with her Sir John Falstaff; and it was not at all likely that she
      would relinquish possession of the fat knight, until commanded by the
      inexorable separatist that parts the best friends. While Uncle Timothy, on
      his way homeward, was whistling, not for &ldquo;want of thought,&rdquo; but the
      figure, he espied a new Boar's Head in the immediate vicinity of the old
      one; and, as the attraction was too powerful to be resisted, he walked in,
      and soon found himself in a spacious apartment, carved, fretted, and
      mullioned in the ancient style; the furniture was grotesquely ornamented
      and antique; the holly and mistletoe were disposed in various parts of the
      room; a huge fire blazed cheerfully; and round a massy oak table, black
      with age, sat Falstaff, Prince Henry, Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew
      Ague-cheek, Sir Hugh Evans, Justice Shallow, Poins, Peto, Touchstone,
      Corporal Nym, Ancient Pistol, and Lieutenant Bardolph! That &ldquo;base-string
      of humility,&rdquo; Francis, waited upon the company; and the shrill tones of
      Hostess Quickly were heard in an angry colloquy with the &ldquo;roaring girl,&rdquo;
       Doll Tearsheet. A boar's head with a lemon in his mouth adorned the centre
      of the table, and immediately before Sir John Falstaff was a magnificent
      bowl of sugared sack compounded by the dame n her very best humour, and
      not excelled by that memorable draught which the oily knight so cosily
      lapped down, when he swore to mine hostess, &ldquo;upon a parcel-gilt goblet,
      sitting in her Dolphin Chamber at the round-table, by a sea-coal fire,&rdquo;
       that he would marry her and make her &ldquo;my lady.&rdquo; Every guest had a horn cup
      silver-mounted; and black jacks of sparkling ale, and cakes in abundance,
      strewed the festive board. Some racy joke on Bardolph's burning nose had
      just been fired off, and the company were in high merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Uncle Timothy to himself, &ldquo;this is a masquerade. I am an
      unbidden guest; but the Enchanter's wand is over me, and I cannot either
      advance or retire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Andrew thrummed his viol-de-gambo; and Sir Toby, having fortified
      himself with a long draught out of a black jack, with true heartiness of
      voice and gesture struck up a glee.

      The room now seemed to extend in width and in length; the sounds of
      revelry ceased, and other characters appeared upon the scene. Lady
      Macbeth, her eyes bending on vacancy, her lips moving convulsively, her
      voice audible, but in fearful whispers, slept her last sleep of darkness,
      guilt, and terror. The Weird Sisters danced round their magic caldron,
      hideous, anomalous, and immortal! The noble Moor ended &ldquo;life's fitful
      season,&rdquo; remorseful and heartbroken. The &ldquo;Majesty of buried Denmark&rdquo;
       revisited &ldquo;the pale glimpses of the moon.&rdquo; Ariel, dismissed by Pros-pero,
      warbled his valedictory strain, and flew to his bright dwelling, &ldquo;under
      the blossom that hangs on the bough.&rdquo; The chiefs and sages of imperial
      Rome swept along in silent majesty. Lear, on his knees, bareheaded, with
      heavenward eye, quivering lip, and hands clasped together in agony,
      pronounced the terrible curse, and in his death realised all that can be
      imagined of human woe. Shylock, the representative of a once-despised and
      persecuted race, pleaded his cause before the senate, and lost it by a
      quibble. Obe-ron, Puck, and the ethereal essences of a Midsummer Night's
      Dream flitted in the moonbeams. Benedick and Beatrice had their wars of
      wit and combats of the tongue. The Lady Constance, alternately
      reproachful, despairing, and frenzied, exhibited a matchless picture of
      maternal tenderness. Juliet breathed forth her sighs to the chaste stars.
      Isabella read a lesson to haughty authority, when she asks her brother's
      forfeited life at the hands of the Duke, worthy of holy seer or sage *;
      and Ophelia, in her distraction, was simple, touching, and sublime.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * An eminent dignitary of the Church of England was once
     discoursing with the author on the morality of Shakspere. He
     regretted that the Bard had not spoken on that most glorious
     of all subjects, Man's Redemption, beyond a few lines
     (exquisitely beautiful) in the first seene of Hamlet. The
     author immediately pointed out the following terse, but
     transcendant passage from &ldquo;Measure for Measure.&rdquo;

     &ldquo;Why, all the souls that were, were forfeit once;

     And HE that might the 'vantage best have took,

     Found out the remedy.&rdquo;

     It would pass the bounds of the most exalted eulogy to
     record the prelate's answer, and how deeply affected he was
     whilst making it.
</pre>
    <p>
      Though these soul-stirring scenes were perfectly familiar to Uncle
      Timothy, and from youth to age had been his morning study and his nightly
      dream, they had never been invested with such an absorbing reality before,
      and he stood transfixed, a wondering spectator of the glorious vision,&mdash;for
      such to his aching sight it seemed to be. At this moment, the embroidered
      arras that hung before the oriel window of the tapestried chamber was
      slowly drawn aside, and the <i>figure of Shakspere</i>, his eyes beaming
      with immortality, and his lofty brow discoursing of all things past,
      present, and to come, stood revealed to view! &ldquo;Flowers of all hues, and
      without thorn the rose,&rdquo; sprung up spontaneously beneath his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And as he walk'd along th' enamell'd bed
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of flow'rs, disposed in many a fairy ring,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Celestial music answer d to his tread,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As if his feet had touch'd some hidden spring
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Of harmony&mdash;so soft the airs did breathe
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      In the charmed ear&mdash;around&mdash;above&mdash;beneath?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke&mdash;But his voice was of &ldquo;no sound that the earth knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sensations of Uncle Timothy grew intensely painful&mdash;amounting
      almost to agony. He made a sudden effort to rush forward, and in making
      it, <i>awoke!</i> when he found himself seated snugly in an arm-chair
      before a bright &ldquo;sea-coal fire,&rdquo; at the Mother Red Cap, where he had
      fallen asleep after the exit of the Bartholomew Fair troop, in their
      progress to the &ldquo;<i>Rounds</i>.&rdquo; And thus ended Uncle Timothy's <i>Vision
      of the Boar's Head!</i>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>entlemen, on this
      anniversary of St. Bartholomew, let us not forget that we owe his Fair to
      a priest and jester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A priest and a jester, Mr. Merripall?&mdash;ha! ha! ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sooth, Brother Stiflegig,&rdquo; replied the comical coffin-maker to his
      inquiring mute, whose hollow laugh sounded like a double knock; &ldquo;and the
      merry monk is no more to be blamed for the disorders that, fungus-like,
      have grown out of it, than is Sir Christopher Wren for the cobwebs and
      dust that deface the dome of St. Paul's. Right is not always the <i>reverse</i>
      of wrong. Brush away the cobwebs and the dust, but spare the dome. Don't
      cut off a man's head to cure his toothach, or lop off his leg to banish
      his gout <i>in toto!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter clause of this remark was much applauded by a sensitive member,
      who had evinced great anxiety to protect his physiognomy from the cutting
      draught of the door; and by another, who was equally careful to keep his
      ten toes from being trod upon. But the sexton and the two mutes exchanged
      significant glances, that plainly hinted their non-approval of this
      anti-professional, ultraliberality on the part of the comical
      coffin-maker.
    </p>

    <p>
      We were passing by those ancient houses in Duke Street, Smithfield,
      undecided whether or not to drop in upon the little Drysalter, when our
      attention was arrested by this chorus of mirth proceeding from one of the
      many obscure hostelries with which these ancient turnings and windings
      abound. We had stumbled on the Pig and Tinder-box, near Bartholomew Close.
      The chair was on his legs,&mdash;an exceedingly long pair, in black
      stockings,&mdash;leading a loud cheer. Mr. Merripall, the comical
      coffin-maker, was president of the Antiqueeruns. On each side of him sat
      his two mutes, Messrs. Hatband and Stiflegig; the sexton, Mr. Shovelton,
      by virtue of his office, was vice; the rest were tradesmen in the
      neighbourhood, to whom porter, pipes, punch, purl, pigtail, and politics
      were a pleasing solace after the business of the day; and a warlike
      character was given to the club by the infusion of some of the Honourable
      the Artillery Company, and the &ldquo;angel visits&rdquo; of a city-marshal. Its name,
      though implying the reverse of a jest, had its origin in a joke, arising
      from the mispronunciation of a member, to whom a little learning had
      proved a dangerous thing. This intelligent brother, at the christening of
      the club, moved that it be called the &ldquo;<i>Antiqueeruns</i>,&rdquo; from the
      antiquity of their quarter and quality, which was carried, as he
      triumphantly announced, &ldquo;<i>my ninny contra decency!</i>&rdquo; (nemine
      contradicenti?) A palpable misnomer,&mdash;for the quorum consisted of the
      queerest fellows imaginable, and their president, Mr. Merripall, was a
      host in fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our entrance had not been noticed during their upstanding jollity; but
      now, when every member was seated, we became &ldquo;the observed of all
      observers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spies in the camp!&rdquo; growled a priggish person of punchy proportions, with
      a little round dumpling head, and short legs, whose pompous peculiarities
      had been sorely quizzed by some prying penny-a-liner. &ldquo;I move, Mr. Cheer,
      that our fifteenth rule be read by the vice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spies in the camp, Mr. Allgag!&mdash;pooh! Yet what signifies, if there's
      no treason in it? The gentlemen have only mistaken a private room for a
      public one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all very well, Mr. President, for you to say there was no malice
      aforethought to broil us on their penny gridiron, when these people popped
      in upon us whipsy dicksy (ipse dixit?) and un-awars. But&rdquo; (rapping the
      table) &ldquo;we live in an age of spies and spinnage!&rdquo; (espionage?)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Gammon</i> and spinnage!&rdquo; chuckled the comical coffin-maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order! order!&rdquo; from several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cheer is out of order! A gentleman don't oughtn't to be interrupted
      will he nil he, vie et harness (vi et armis?). Who seconds my motion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; winked the sexton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll put it to the vote. As many of you as are of this opinion hold
      up your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Allgag, though an oyster in intellect, was the small oracle of an
      insignificant, captious, factious section of the Antiqueeruns. A few hands
      were held up, and the fulminating fifteenth rule was read aloud, which
      imposed a fine of five shillings on each intruder, and a forcible ejection
      from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blush for these pitiful proceedings,&rdquo; exclaimed the comical
      coffin-maker; &ldquo;and rather than become a party to them, I will vacate the
      chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well and good! I'll be your locum trimmings,&rdquo; (tenens?) rejoined the
      Holborn Hill Demosthenes; and he half strutted, half waddled from his
      seat, as if to take possession. The mutes looked grave; even the
      rebellious vice was panic-struck at the prodigious boldness of Mr. Allgag.
      &ldquo;I'll take the cheer. As for the turning out part of the story&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who talks of turning out?&rdquo; cried the Lauréat of Little Britain, bursting
      suddenly into the room. &ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; addressing the affrighted sexton, who
      shook his head ruefully in the negative; &ldquo;or you?&rdquo; advancing to the
      terrified mutes, who shook in their shoes. &ldquo;Not you! good Master
      Merri-pall,&rdquo; giving the comical coffin-maker a hearty shake by the hand.
      &ldquo;Or is it you, sir?&rdquo; placing himself in a provokingly pugnacious attitude
      before the Holborn Hill Demosthenes. &ldquo;What a bluster about an
      unintentional intrusion! If, gentlemen, my friends must be fined, I will
      be their guarantee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he ejected us with gentle violence from the room, and in a few
      minutes after we found ourselves in his elegant little library, where
      everything was as neat and prim as himself,&mdash;not&rdquo; a bust, bijou, or
      book out of its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A heavy retribution had well nigh fallen upon you, my good friends, for
      passing my door without looking in. It matters not what chance medley
      brought me to your rescue; but I'm a merciful man, and the only fine I
      impose is, that you sit down, be comfortable, and stay till I turn you
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fine seemed so very moderate, that we were glad to compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything around you,&mdash;books, plate, pictures,&mdash;ay, my
      old-fashioned housekeeper into the bargain,&mdash;are the selection of
      Uncle Tim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by this beeswing, Mr. Bosky, we guess Uncle Timothy is butler too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most profoundly opined! Yonder,&rdquo; pointing to an antique painted glass
      door, &ldquo;is his cabinet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'There Caxton sleeps, with Wynkyn at his side,

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

      &ldquo;An odd thought strikes me. What say you to a dish of conjurors, with a
      garnish of monsters and mountebanks, served up by mine host of St.
      Bartlemy, Uncle Tim?&rdquo; And Mr. Bosky disappeared through the glass door,
      but returned in an instant, bearing in his hand a smartly-bound volume.

      The learned need not be told that a fair was originally a market for the
      purchase and sale of all sorts of commodities; and what care the unlearned
      for its derivation? For them it suffices that 'tis a market for fun. Our
      merry Prior of St. Bartholomew knowing the truth of the old proverb, that,
      &ldquo;all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,&rdquo; mingled pastime with
      business, and put Momus into partnership with Mammon. For many years they
      jogged on together, somewhat doggedly, to be sure, for Momus was a fellow
      of uproarious merriment; and while Mammon, with furred gown and gold
      chain, was weighing atoms and splitting straws, Momus split the sides of
      his customers, and so entirely won them over to his jocular way of doing
      business, that Mammon was drummed out of the firm and the fair. But Mammon
      has had his revenge, by causing Momus to be confined to such narrow
      bounds, that his lions and tigers lack space to roar in, and his giants
      are pinched for elbow room. * Moreover, he and his sly bottle-holder, Mr.
      Cupidity Cant (who from the time of Prynne to the present has been a
      bitter foe to good fellowship), threaten to drive poor Momus out of house
      and home. Out upon the ungracious varlets! let them sand their own sugar,

      Father Rahére founded the Priory, Hospital, and Church of St. Bartholomew
      in Smithfield, at the instigation ('tis said) of the saint himself, who
      appeared to him in Rome, whither he had repaired on a pilgrimage. We learn
      from the Cottonian MSS. that he &ldquo;of te hawnted the Kyng's palice, and
      amo'ge the noysefull presse of that tumultuous courte, enforsed hymselfe
      with jolite and carnal suavité: ther yn spectaclis, yn metys, yn playes,
      and other courtely mokkys and trifyllis, intruding he lede forth the
      besynesse of alle the daye.&rdquo; He was a &ldquo;pleasant witted gentleman,&rdquo; and
      filled the post of minstrel to King Henry the First, which comprehended
      musician, improvisatore, jester, &amp;c.; and Henry the Second granted to
      the monastery of St. Bartholomew (of which Rahére was the first prior) the
      privilege of a three days' fair for the drapers and clothiers: hence Cloth
      Fair. His ashes rest under a magnificent tomb in the church of St.
      Bartholomew the Great. This beautiful shrine is still carefully preserved.
      How different has been the fate of the desecrated sepulchre of the &ldquo;moral
      Gower,&rdquo; which the Beetian Borough brawlers would have pounded, with their
      Ladye Chapel, to macadamise the road!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worthy of observation,&rdquo; (says Paul Hentzer, 1598,) &ldquo;that every year
      when the Fair is held, it is usual for the Mayor to ride into Smithfield,
      dressed in his scarlet gown, and about his neck is a golden chain, besides
      that particular ornament that distinguishes the staple of the kingdom. He
      is followed by the Aldermen in scarlet gowns, and a mace and a cap are
      borne before him. Where the yearly fair is proclaimed a tent is placed,
      and after the ceremony is over the mob begin to wrestle before them, two
      at a time, and conquerors are rewarded by them by money thrown from the
      tent. After this, a parcel of live rabbits are turned loose among the
      crowd, and hunted by a number of boys, with great noise, &amp;c. Before
      this time, also, there was an old custom for the <i>Scholars of London</i>
      to meet at this festival, at the <i>Priory of St. Bartholomew</i>, to
      dispute in logic and grammar, and upon a <i>bank, under a tree, (!)</i>
      the best of them were rewarded with <i>bows and silver arrows?</i>
      Bartholomew Fair, until about 1743, was held a fortnight; and the spacious
      area of Smithfield was filled with booths for drolls and interludes, in
      which many popular comedians of the time performed, from the merry reign
      of Mat Coppinger to the laughing days of Ned Shuter. Sir Samuel Fludyer,
      in 1762, and Mr. Alderman Bull, (<i>not John Bull!</i>) in 1774, enforced
      some stringent regulations that amounted almost to an abolition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now, my merry masters! let us take a stroll into the ancient fair of
      St. Bartholomew, <i>vulgo</i> Bartlemy, with John Littlewit, the uxorious
      proctor; Win-the-fight Littlewit, his fanciful wife; Dame Purecraft, a
      painful sister: Zeal-of-the-land Busy, the puritan Banbury man; and our
      illustrious cicerone, rare Ben Jonson.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1614, and long before, one of the most delicious city dainties
      was a Bartholomew <i>roast pig</i>. * A cold turkey-pie and a glass of
      rich malmsey were &ldquo;creature comforts&rdquo; not to be despised even by such
      devout sons of self-denial as Mr. Zeal-of-the-land Busy, who always popped
      in at pudding-time. ** But Bartholomew pig, &ldquo;a meat that is nourishing,
      and may be longed for,&rdquo; that may be eaten, &ldquo;very exceeding well eaten,&rdquo;
       but not in a fair, was the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of savoury morsels:
      therefore Win-the-fight Little wit, with a strawberry breath, cherry lips,
      and apricot cheeks, the better half (not in folly!) of one of &ldquo;the pretty
      wits of Paul's,&rdquo; shams Abram, and pretends to long for it, in order to
      overcome the scruples and qualms of Dame Purecraft and the Banbury man,
      who, but for such longing, would have never consented to her visiting the
      fair.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          *  &ldquo;Now London's Mayor, on saddle new,
          Rides to the Fair of Bartlemew;
          He twirls his chain, and looketh big,
          As if to fright the head of pig,

     That gaping lies on every stall.&rdquo;&mdash;Davenant. Shakspere, in
     the First Part of King Henry the Fourth, speaks of an ox
     being roasted at Bartholomew Fair.

          ** &ldquo;I ne'er saw a parson without a good nose,&mdash;
          But the devil's as welcome wherever he goes.&rdquo;&mdash;Swift.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Rabbi being called upon by the dame to legalise roast pig, proposes
      that it shall be eaten with a reformed mouth, and not after the profane
      fashion of feeding; and, that the weak may be comforted, himself will
      accompany them to the fair, and eat exceedingly, and prophesy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the minor delicacies of Ursula's * cuisine&mdash;Ursula, &ldquo;uglye of
      clieare,&rdquo; the pig-woman and priestess of St. Bartlemy, &ldquo;all fire and fat!&rdquo;&mdash;are
      tobacco, colt's-foot, bottled-ale, and tripes; and a curious picture of
      Smithfield manners is given in her instructions to Mooncalf to froth the
      cans well, jog the bottles o' the buttock, shink out the first glass ever,
      and drink with all companies.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          *  &ldquo;Her face all bowsy,

          Like a roste pigges eare,
          Brystled Avith here.

      We have an irruption of other popular characters into the fair, all in
      high keeping with the time and place:&mdash;a costard-monger; a gilt
      gingerbread woman; a mountebank; a corn-cutter; a wrestler; a cut-purse (a
      babe of booty, or child of the horn-thumb!); a gamester; a ballad-singer;
      an &ldquo;ostler, trade-fallen a roarer (a swash-buckler, in later times a
      mohock); puppet-show keepers and watchmen; Bartholomew Cokes, a natural
      born fool and squire; Waspe, his shrewder serving-man; Overdo, a
      bacchanalian justice; a gang of gypsies, and their hedge-priest, patriarch
      of the cut-purses, or Patrico to the A bram men and their prickers and
      prancers; and lastly, Mr. Lanthorn Leatherhead, a supposed caricature of
      Inigo Jones, with whom Ben Jonson was associated in some of his
      magnificent court masques. All these characters exhibit their humours, and
      present a living picture of what Bartholomew Fair was in 1614. We have the
      exact dress of the flaunting City Madam&mdash;a huge velvet custard, or
      three-cornered bonnet; for these pretenders to sanctity not only adorned
      their outward woman with the garments of vanity, but were the principal
      dealers in feathers (another fashionable part of female dress in the days
      of Elizabeth and James I.) in the Blackfriars. All the merchandise of
      Babylon (i. e. the fair!) is spread out to our view; Jews-trumps, rattles,
      mousetraps, penny ballads, * purses, pin-cases, Tobie's dogs, &ldquo;comfortable
      bread,&rdquo; (spiced gingerbread,) hobbyhorses, drums, lions, bears,
      Bartholomew whistling birds, (wooden toys,) dolls, ** and Orpheus and his
      fiddle in gin-work! We have its cant phrases, mendacious tricks, and
      practical jokes; and are invited into &ldquo;a sweet delicate booth,&rdquo; with
      boughs, to eat roast pig with the fire o' juniper and rosemary branches;
      and &ldquo;it were great obstinacy, high and horrible obstinacy, to decline or
      resist the good titillation of the famelic sense,&rdquo; and not enter the gates
      of the unclean for once, with the liquorish Rabbi.

     *  Gifford says, &ldquo;In Jonson's time, scarcely any ballad was
     printed without a woodcut illustrative of its subject. If it
     was a ballad of 'pure love,' or of 'good life/ which
     afforded no scope for the graphic talents of the Grub Street
     Apelles, the portrait of 'good Queen Elizabeth,'
     magnificently adorned, with the globe and sceptre, formed no
     unwelcome substitute for her loving subjects.&rdquo;

     ** The following was the costume of a Bartlemy Fair doll, or
     baby:&mdash;

          &ldquo;Her petticoat of sattin,
          Her gown of crimson tabby,
          Laced up before, and spangled o'er,

      The sound beating of Justice Overdo, Waspe's elevation of Cokes on
      pick-back, and the final confutation of Zeal-of-the-land Busy, complete
      the humours of, and give the last finish-ing-touches to this authentic and
      curious picture of ancient Bartholomew Fair.

      Bravo, Ben Jonson! Not the surly, envious, malignant Ben, but the rare, <i>chère</i>
      Bartlemy Fair Ben! the prince of poets! the king of good fellows! the
      learned oracle of the Mermaid and the Devil; * the chosen companion of the
      gallant Raleigh; the poetical father of many worthy adopted sons; and, to
      sum up emphatically thy various excellencies, the friend, &ldquo;fellow&rdquo; and
      elegiast of Shakspere!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In the Apollo Room in the Devil Tavern (on the site of
     which stands the Banking-house of Messrs. Child,) Ben Jonson
     occupied the President's chair, surrounded by the &ldquo;Erudit i,
     urbani, hilares, honesti&rdquo; of that glorious age. Take his
     picture as drawn by Shakerley Marmion, a contemporary
     dramatist of some note, and (as Anthony Wood styles him) a
     &ldquo;goodly proper gentleman.&rdquo;

          &ldquo;The boon Delphic god
          Drinks sack, and keeps his Bacchanalia,
          And has his incense, and his altars smoking,
          And speaks in sparkling prophesies&rdquo;

     His Leges Conviviales were engraved in black marble over the
     chimney; and over the door were inscribed the following
     verses by the same master-hand.

          &ldquo;Welcome all who lead or follow
          To the oracle of Apollo:
          Here he speaks out of his pottle,
          Or the tripos, his tower bottle;
          All his answers are divine,
          Truth itself doth flow in wine.
          Hang up all the poor hop-drinkers,
          Cries old Sim, the king of shinkers;
          He the half of life abuses,
          That sits watering with the Muses.
          Those dull girls no good ean mean us;
          Wine&mdash;it is the milk of Venus,
          And the poet's horse accounted:
          Ply it, and you all are mounted.
          'Tis the true Phobian liquor,
          Cheers the brains, makes wit the quieker;
          Pays all debts, cures all diseases,
          And at once three senses pleases.
          Welcome all who lead or follow
          To the oracle of Apollo!&rdquo;

     Such an association of intellectual minds, where worldly
     distinctions are unknown, where rank lays down its state,
     and genius forgets the inequalities of fortune, is the
     highest degree of felicity that human nature can arrive at.

      Yes, thou didst behold him face to face! Great and glorious privilege!
      Thou his detractor! What a beauteous garland hast thou thrown upon his

      The death of James I. (for Jamie was much addicted to sports, and loved
      the Puritans, as the Puritans and Lucifer love holy water!) was &ldquo;a heavy
      blow, and a great discouragement&rdquo; to the nation's jollity: and the
      troubles and treasons of the succeeding unhappy reign indisposed men's
      hearts to merriment, and turned fair England into a howling wilderness.
      Bartholomew Fair in 1641 * exhibits a sorry shadow of its joyous
      predecessor&mdash;'Tis Fat Jack, mountain of mirth! dwindled into the lean
      and slipper'd pantaloon! Zeal-of-the-land Busy had become rampant; and
      Dame Ursula, if the old lady yet lived, was most probably a reformed
      sister, and purveyor of roast pig to the Rabbi at home!

      As a picture, it wants the vivid colouring of the former great painter. It
      seems to have been limned by a wet, or parcel puritan, a dead wall between
      pantile and puppet-show! Our first move is into Christ Church cloisters,
      &ldquo;which are hung so full of pictures, that you would take that place, or
      rather mistake it, for St. Peter's in Rome. And now, being arrived through
      the long walke, to Saint Bartholomew's hospitall,&rdquo; he draws a ludicrous
      picture of a &ldquo;handsome wench&rdquo; bartering her good name for &ldquo;a moiety of
      bone-lace; a slight silver bodkin; a hoop-ring, or the like toye.&rdquo;
       Proceeding into the heart of the fair, it becomes necessary that while one
      eye is watching the motion of the puppets, the other should look sharp to
      the pockets. &ldquo;Here's a knave in a foole's coat, with a trumpet sounding,
      or on a drumme beating, invites you, and would faine persuade you to see
      his puppets; there is a rogue like a wild woodman, or in an antick-ship,
      like an incubus, desires your company to view his motion. On the other
      side, Hocus Pocus, with three yards of tape, or ribbon in's hand, shews
      his legerdemaine * to the admiration and astonishment of a company of
      cock-oloaches.

      Amongst these you shall see a grey goose-cap (as wise as the rest) with a
      'what do ye lacke?' in his mouth, stand in his boothe, shaking a rattle,
      or scraping on a fiddle, with which children are so taken that they
      presently cry out for these fopperies. And all these together make such a
      distracted noise that you would think Babel was not comparable to it. Here
      there are also your gamesters in action; some turning off a whimsey,
      others throwing for pewter, who can quickly dissolve a round shilling into
      a three-halfpenny saucer. Long Lane at this time looks very faire,-and
      puts on her best cloaths with the wrong side outward, so turn'd for their
      better turning off; and Cloth Faire is now in great request; well fare the

      nothing of its jollity. Thomas Cotterell &ldquo;from the King's Arm's Tavern,

      dreaming that in the ensuing February he should be brought before one,
      (for stealing a watch and seven pounds in money,) and sent on a pilgrimage
      to Tyburn-tree! He was a poet, and wrote a volume * of adulatory verses,

     * Poems, Songs, and Love-Verses upon several subjects. By

     Portsmouth; of whom, amongst an hundred extravagant things,

      Upon the credit of which they took a lodging in Smithfield, and made shift
      to get up a small booth to shew juggling tricks in, the art of hocus
      pocus, and pouder-le-pimp. The score being deep on all hands, the people
      clamouring for money, and customers coming but slowly in, they consulted
      how to rub off, and give their creditors the bag to hold. To this
      Coppinger dissented, saying he would find out the way to mend this dulness
      of trading; and he soon effected it by a lucky chance. A country fellow,
      on his return from Newgate-market on horseback, resolving to have a gape
      at Jack Pudding, sat gazing, with his mouth at half-cock; and, so intent
      was he, that his senses seemed to be gone wool-gathering. Coppinger,
      whispering some of his companions, they stept to &ldquo;Tom Noddies&rdquo; horse, one
      of them ungirthing him, and taking off the bridle, the reins of which the
      fellow held in his hand, they bore him on the pack-saddle on each side,
      and led the horse sheer from under him; whilst another with counterfeit
      horns, and a vizard, put his head out of the head-stall, and kept nodding
      forwards, so that &ldquo;Ninny&rdquo; verily supposed, by the tugging of the reins,
      that he was still on &ldquo;cock-horse!&rdquo; The signal being given, they let him
      squash to the ground, pack-saddle and all; when, terrified at the sight of
      the supposed devil he had got in a string, and concluding Hocus Pocus had
      conjured his horse into that antic figure, he scrambled up, and betaking
      him to his heels back into the country, frightened his neighbours with
      dismal stories that Dr. Faustus and Friar Bacon were alive again, and
      transforming horses into devils in Bartholomew Fair! The tale, gathering
      as it spread, caused the booth to be thronged; which piece of good-luck
      was solely attributable to Coppinger's ingenuity.

      Plain Joe Haynes, * the learned Doctor Haynes, or the dignified Count
      Haynes,&mdash;for by these several titles he was honourably distinguished,&mdash;was
      the hero of a variety of vagabondical adventures both at home and abroad.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Wood's Athenæ Oxon. ii. p. 976. &ldquo;Joseph Haynes, or Heynes,
     matriculated as a servitor of Queen's College, 3d May, 1689.
     Mr. Ja. Tirrel saith he is a great actor and maker of plays;
     but I find him not either in Langbaine or Term Cat/' Old
     Anthony, like &ldquo;good old Homer,&rdquo; sometimes nods. Haynes had
     been upon the stage many years before, and was too
     profligate to be admitted of the university at that period.

     In the memoir of Joe Haynes, in the Lives of the Gamesters,
     he is said to have died in the beginning of the year 1700,
     aged 53. This is a mistake.

     He was married, as appears from the following lines in the
     Prologue to &ldquo;The Injured Lovers.&rdquo;

     &ldquo;Joe Haynes's fate is now become my share,

     For I'm a poet, marrÿd, and a player.&rdquo;

     Downes says he was one of those &ldquo;who came not into the
     company until after they had begun in Drury Lane.&rdquo; Drury
     Lane first opened on 8th April, 1663.

     He wrote and spoke a variety of prologues and epilogues,
     particularly the epilogue to the &ldquo;Unhappy Kindness, or
     Fruitless Revenge,&rdquo; in the habit of a horse-offieer, mounted
     on an ass, in 1697. In after times his example was imitated
     by Shuter, Liston, and Wilkinson (not Tate).

     His principal characters were, Syringe, in the Relapse;
     Roger, in Æsop; Sparkish, in the Country Wife; Lord
     Plausible, in the Plain Dealer; Pamphlet and Rigadoon, in
     Love and a Bottle; Tom Errand, in the Constant Couple; Mad
     Parson, in the Pilgrim; Benito, in the Assignation; Noll
     Bluff, in the Old Bachelor; Rumour, in A Plot and No Plot,
     (to which, in 1697, he spoke the prologue); and Jamy, in
     Sawney the Scot.
</pre>
    <p>
      He is the first comedian who rode an ass upon the stage. He acted the
      mountebank, Waltho Van Clutterbank, High German, chemical, wonder-working
      doctor and dentifricator, and spoke his famous &ldquo;Horse-doctor's harangue&rdquo;
       to the mob. He challenged a celebrated quack called &ldquo;The Unborn Doctor,&rdquo;
       at the town of Hertford, on a market-day, to have a trial of skill with
      him. Being both mounted on the public stage, and surrounded by a numerous
      auditory eager to hear this learned dispute, Joe desired that each might
      stand upon a joint stool. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;I thank you for your
      good company, and hope soon to prove how grossly you have been deceived by
      this arch-impostor. I come hither neither to get a name, nor an estate:
      the first, by many miraculous cures performed in Italy, Spain, Holland,
      France, and England, <i>per totum terrarium, orbem</i>, has long been
      established. As to the latter, those Emperors, Kings, and foreign
      potentates, whom I have snatched from the gaping jaws of death, whose
      image I have the honour to wear (showing several medals), have
      sufficiently rewarded me. Besides, I am the seventh son of a seventh son;
      so were my father and grandfather. To convince you, therefore, that what I
      affirm is truth, I prognosticate some heavy judgment will fall on the head
      of that impudent quack. May the charlatan tumble ingloriously, while the
      true doctor remains unhurt!&rdquo; At which words, Haynes's Merry-Andrew, who
      was underneath the stage, with a cord fast to B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s
      stool, just as B-was going to stutter out a reply, pulled the stool from
      under him, and down he came; which, passing for a miracle, Joe was borne
      home to his lodging in triumph, and B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;hooted out of
      the town. *
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of Doctor Haynes's miraculous mock cures, were the Duchess of
      Boromolpho of a cramp in her tongue; the Count de Rodomontado of a bilious
      passion, after a surfeit of buttered parsnips; and Duke Philorix of a
      dropsy&mdash;of which he died! He invites his patients to the &ldquo;Sign of the
      Prancers,&rdquo; in vico vulgo dicto, Rattlecliffero, something south-east of
      Templum Danicum in the Square of Profound-Close, not far from
      &ldquo;Titter-Tatter Fair!&rdquo; He was a good-looking fellow, of singular
      accomplishments, and in great request among the ladies. &ldquo;With the
      agreeableness of my mien, ** the gaiety of my conversation, and the
      gallantry of my dancing, I charmed the fair sex wherever I came.

     tract is intended as a skit upon Dryden, whose easy
     &ldquo;conversion and reconversion&rdquo; are satirised in a very
     laughable manner. In 1689, Haynes spoke his &ldquo;Recantation
     Prologue upon his first appearance on the stage after his
     return from Rome,&rdquo; in the character of a theatrical
     penitent!

     John Davies ridicules the coxcombs of his day, that it
     engrossed the whole of their meal-times in talk of plays,
     and censuring of players.

     &ldquo;As good play as work for nought, some say,

     But players get much good by nought but play.&rdquo;

      help me to string my lute? Signor Giusippe,' says another, 'shall we see
      you at night in the grotto behind the Duke's palace?' 'Signor Giusippe,'
      says a third, 'when will you teach me the last new song you made for the
      Prince of Tuscany?' and so, i' faith they Giusipped me, till I had sworn
      at least to a dozen assignations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His waggery was amusing to all who were not the butts of it. He once kept
      a merchant that had a laced-band which reached from shoulder to shoulder,
      two good hours in a coffee-house near the Exchange, while he explained the
      meaning of chevaux de frize; telling him there were horses in Frize-land
      that were bullet-proof! At another time he parleyed with a grocer a full
      quarter of an hour in the street, inquiring which was the near est way
      from Fleet Street to the Sun Tavern in Piccadilly; whether down the
      Strand, and so by Charing Cross; or through Lincoln's Inn Fields and
      Covent-Garden? though the simpleton declared his spouse sent him
      post-haste for a doctor, and&mdash;for all that Joe knew&mdash;made him
      lose an heir-apparent to &ldquo;some dozen pounds of raisins, as many silver
      apostle spoons, Stow's London, and Speed's Chronicle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His astonished father-confessor, while listening to his sham catalogue of
      frightful enormities, looked as death-like as a frolicsome party of indigo
      porters in a dark cellar, by the melancholy light of burnt brandy! &ldquo;For,&rdquo;
       said the penitent wag, &ldquo;last Wednesday I stole a consecrated bell from one
      of St. Anthony's holy pigs, and coined it into copper farthings! Such a
      day I pinned a fox's tail on a monk's cowl; and passing by an old
      gentlewoman sitting in her elbow-chair by the door, reading '<i>The
      Spiritual Carduus-posset for a Sinner's Belly-Ache</i>,&rdquo; (this, saving our
      noble comedian's presence, is more after the fashion of Rabbi Busy, than
      Friar Peter!) &ldquo;I abstracted her spectacles from off her venerable purple
      nose, and converted them to the profane use of lighting my tobacco by the
      sunshine.&rdquo;

      under his window, &ldquo;there is my St. Bartlemy-tide chorister. For twenty
